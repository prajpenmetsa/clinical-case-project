    "Introduction": "Introduction\nSalivary gland tumors are rare, representing 6–8% of \nhead and neck tumors [1]. Among these, adenoid cystic \ncarcinoma (ACC) is a significant malignant subset, \naccounting for approximately 10% of all salivary gland \nneoplasms and about 1% of head and neck malignancies \n[2, 3]. ACC affects both major and minor salivary glands, \nwith a slight predilection for the minor glands. The \nincidence of ACC is estimated to be 0.4–13.5 cases per \n100,000 person-years, highlighting its rarity [4].*Correspondence:\nStephen Gray\nstgray@mfa.gwu.edu\n1 The George Washington University School of Medicine and Health \nSciences, Washington, DC, USA\n2 The George Washington Transplant Institute, Department of Surgery, \nThe George Washington University Hospital, Washington, DC, USA\n3 Department of Medicine, The George Washington University School \nof Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC, USA\n4 Department of Pathology, The George Washington University School \nof Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC, USA\n5 Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Medicine, Allegheny \nHealth Network, Pittsburgh, PA, USA\nPage 2 of 5 Walker et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2025) 19:126 \nACCs are characterized by slow growth, high rates \nof distant metastasis, and difficulty in resection due to \nmultiple recurrences [3, 4]. The 5-year survival rate for \nACC is relatively high at 89%, but this drops significantly \nto 40% at 15 years, underscoring the importance of longterm follow-up [5]. The preferential sites of metastases \nare the lungs (occurring in up to 70% of metastatic cases) \nand bone, followed by the brain and liver [6]. Most liver \nmetastases are derived from non-parotid ACCs and are \noften related to local recurrence or metastases to other \norgans, particularly the lung [7]. Notably, isolated liver \nmetastases from ACC are extremely rare, with only a \nhandful of cases reported in literature. In contrast, basal \ncell adenocarcinoma (BCACs), another malignant subset \nof salivary gland tumors, accounts for less than 1% of \nsalivary gland tumors and are generally considered lowgrade carcinomas that are locally destructive and tend \nto recur [2]. Unlike ACC, BCACs only occasionally \nmetastasize, and very rarely to a distant site [8].\nWe herein report the case of a patient with a metastatic \nsalivary gland tumor who presented initially with a \nsignificant hepatic mass originally believed to be a \nprimary tumor. This case highlights the importance of \nconsidering rare metastatic presentations of ACC in the \ndifferential diagnosis of liver masses, even in the absence \nof a known primary tumor.\nCase report\nA 29-year-old African American male individual pre sented to the emergency department (ED) for right \nupper quadrant abdominal pain and early satiety. Physi cal examination was unrevealing except for abdominal \ntenderness. His past medical history included 5 years of \ndaily alcohol use and occasional marijuana use. A com puted tomography (CT) scan revealed hepatomegaly \nwith a large mass centered in the left lobe measuring \n14 cm (Fig.  1). Laboratory values showed mildly elevated \ntransaminases, with an alanine transaminase (ALT) of \n51, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 74, and an alka line phosphatase of 93 units/L (Table  1). The patient was \nthen discharged with a planned outpatient hepatology \nfollow-up.\nA total of 1 month later, the patient presented again \nto the ED with the same symptoms; magnetic resonance \nimaging (MRI) revealed a 19  cm enhancing left hepatic \nmass. Laboratory tests demonstrated  a mild elevation \nin transaminases, a negative hepatitis viral panel, and \nunremarkable tumor marker levels, including alphafetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and \ncarbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19.9). After appropriate \npain control, the patient was discharged again with plans \nfor outpatient follow-up.The patient was lost to follow-up owing to insurance \nconcerns, until he presented to a different ED the follow ing month for abdominal pain, vomiting, early satiety, and \nunintentional 10 lb weight loss. Abdominal CT angiogra phy with contrast showed a 21 cm hepatic mass centered \nin the left hepatic lobe (Fig.  2), and given the concern for \nhepatocellular carcinoma, the patient was admitted for \nbiopsy and staging imaging. Laboratory tests revealed \nalkaline phosphatase elevation (451  IU/L) and mildly \nelevated transaminases, with an AST level of 93 units/L \nand an ALT of 45 units/L. His tumor marker laboratory",
    "Results": "results were within normal ranges (CA 19.9 < 14.0; AFP: \n1.97; and CEA: 5.28). A chest CT revealed innumer able bilateral pulmonary nodules measuring up to 8 mm, \nfavoring metastases. Initial histopathological examina tion of the liver biopsy specimens revealed a well-differ entiated carcinoma characterized by a distinctive myxoid \nstroma with tubular and cribriform structures, consistent \nwith metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma. The patient \nunderwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization \n(TACE) and was discharged with a hematology–oncology \nfollow-up.\nHe was readmitted 2 weeks later for a planned repeat \nTACE procedure, as well as a repeat liver biopsy for \nfurther testing. Initial laboratory values on admission \nwere an AST of 44 units/L, ALT of 24 units/L, and alka line phosphatase of 282 units/L. During this admission, \na computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck soft \ntissue with contrast revealed a complex bilobed mass \nin the right parotid gland measuring approximately \n6.5  cm (Fig.  3). Its progression into the parapharyn geal space caused notable deformity of the oropharynx, \nraising further concerns about potential malignancy. \nFig. 1 Initial computed tomography scan demonstrates \nhepatomegaly with a large 14 cm mass in the left lobe\nPage 3 of 5\n Walker et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2025) 19:126 \n \nA biopsy was taken with immunohistochemistry find ings suggestive of ACC (Fig.  4); however, BCAC could \nnot be completely excluded without examination of a \ncompletely removed salivary gland tumor. Therefore, a \npresumptive diagnosis of stage IV adenoid cystic carci noma with metastases to the liver and lung was made. \nGiven the tremendous tumor burden and poor progno sis, the treatment goals were palliative, and the patient \nwas started on a chemotherapeutic regimen with cispl atin and vinorelbine.\nA total of 5 months later, the patient presented to the \nemergency department with neurological symptoms, \nincluding lightheadedness and left-sided weakness. A \nCT scan revealed new right frontal hyperdensities, con sistent with brain metastasis. During this admission, he \nreceived one dose of radiotherapy with a plan to finish five doses. He was then discharged with a planned out patient follow-up.",
    "Discussion": "Discussion\nThis case presents a rare instance of ACC initially \nmanifested as a single hepatic mass. ACC is known for \nits slow growth and tendency for delayed metastasis, \ntypically to the lungs and bones before affecting the liver \n[6].

Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2025) 19:126 \nACC without a known primary tumor. The differential \ndiagnosis of a large hepatic mass without a known \nprimary tumor includes hepatocellular carcinoma, \nmetastatic disease from an unknown primary source, or \nbenign hepatic tumors (for example, hepatic adenoma \nand focal nodular hyperplasia) [9]. The rapid growth of \nthe hepatic mass and the discovery of pulmonary nodules \nraised suspicion for a metastatic process. The distinctive \nhistopathological findings observed in the liver biopsy, \nshowing a well-differentiated carcinoma with myxoid \nstroma, were crucial in guiding the diagnosis towards a \nsalivary gland origin, which was confirmed later with \nimaging and biopsy of the parotid gland. Previous \nliterature associates solid structures on pathologic \nexamination with higher metastatic potential in ACC \nrather than tubular or cribriform structures [10]. Our \npatient, however, presented with distant metastases and \nprimarily tubular and cribriform features on pathologic \nanalysis (Fig. 3).\nThe unique behavior of adenoid cystic carcinoma \n(ACC) is closely linked to its genetic profile. Unlike many \nother cancers, ACC has a specific genetic pattern that \nhelps explain its slow, but persistent spread. Researchers \nhave discovered a particular gene fusion (MYB-NFIB) \nin about half of ACC cases, which appears to drive the \ntumor’s ability to metastasize [11–14]. These genetic \ncharacteristics help explain why ACC can develop \nmetastases years after the initial tumor is treated, and \nwhy it tends to spread to specific organs like the lungs \nand liver [15].Liver metastasis in ACC is rare and typically occurs in \nconjunction with other organ involvement. Our case is \nnotable, as isolated liver metastasis is uncommon, with \nonly a few previous reports in literature [3, 5, 16–19]. The \nmedian survival time for patients with ACC liver metas tases is approximately 14  months, with 1-year survival \nrates at around 55.8% [4].\nThe treatment modalities for these patients are poorly \nunderstood because of their rarity, high degree of \nresistance to chemotherapeutic agents, and recurrence \nfollowing surgical resection [3]. In this case, given the \nextensive tumor burden, a palliative approach combining \nlocal therapy (TACE) with systemic chemotherapy was \nchosen. This aligns with current practices for advanced \nACC, where treatment aims to control symptoms and \npotentially slow disease progression [4].\nOur case contributes to the limited understanding \nof ACC’s atypical presentations, emphasizing the \nimportance of considering salivary gland tumors in the \ndifferential diagnosis of unexplained hepatic lesions. \nThe treatment remains individualized, with a focus on \npalliative care to maximize patient comfort.\nConclusion\nThis case is an example of the atypical presentation of a \nmetastatic salivary gland tumor as a single large hepatic \nmass. This emphasizes the need for clinicians to maintain \na broad differential diagnosis when encountering hepatic \nmasses, particularly in patients without a known primary \nmalignancy. Adenoid cystic carcinoma presenting as \na liver metastasis is exceedingly rare, highlighting the \nimportance of thorough histopathological examination \nand consideration of atypical presentations of salivary \ngland tumors. We recommend comprehensive imaging \nstudies, including head and neck regions, along with \nregular follow-up imaging in similar cases. This report \ncontributes to the limited literature on ACC liver \nmetastasis and addresses the necessity for individualized \ndiagnostic and treatment approaches in managing rare \nsalivary gland malignancies.\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.\nAuthor contributions\nMW and AD drafted the hospital course and contributed to the initial \nmanuscript.
