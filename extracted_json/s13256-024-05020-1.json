    "Background": "Background Superficial acral fibromyxoma is a noncancerous, benign tumor of soft tissue with an unidentified origin. Occurrences of abnormalities on the palm are less frequently documented.\nCase report presentation A 47-year-old East Asian woman presented with a palm tumor on her left knuckle \nthat had been present for 4 months. Four months prior to treatment, a reddish nodule appeared at the site due \nto continuous friction, but the patient did not pay attention to it. Upon physical examination, a pale-reddish nodule \nmeasuring approximately 0.8 × 0.8 cm was observed on the flexion side of the fourth metacarpophalangeal joint \nof the left hand. The nodule was nearly round, exhibited distinct margins, featured slight surface keratosis, and displayed a collar-like alteration at its periphery. The stroma showed significant fibrous proliferation and a myxoid matrix. \nThe cellular composition consisted primarily of spindle-shaped fibroblasts, which were locally arranged in bundles \nwithin the stroma. Sparse slender blood vessels were distributed along with observed red blood cell extravasation. \nImmunohistochemistry of the tumor showed CD34 (+), CD99 (−), desmin (−), epithelial membrane antigen (−). Extensive resection of the mass was performed.",
    "Conclusion": "Conclusion A rounded mass on the palm of the hand may be superficial acral fibromyxoma. The optimal approach \nfor treating superficial acral fibromyxoma involves complete surgical removal of the mass followed by postoperative \nmonitoring.\nKeywords  Superficial acral fibromyxoma, Palm, Skin tutor, Case report",
    "Introduction": "Introduction\nSuperficial acral fibromyxoma (SAF) is a noncancerous \nsoft-tissue tumor observed primarily in middle-aged \nadults, with a higher occurrence among males [1–3]. By \ncontrast, only a few isolated cases have been reported \nin East Asian countries [3]. Painless and gradual growth \nis usually seen in the extremities of the hands and toes, \nthe majority growing near the nail [1, 3, 4]. Malignant \ntransformation has never been reported in this tumor. \nSAF has also been reported to grow on the surface \nof plantar and nail matrix [5, 6]. From a pathological perspective, the anomaly comprises a combination of \nastrocytes and spindle cells within a fibrous myxoid \nmatrix. Immunohistochemical manifestations are \nvaried. Most cases report that the tumor is usually \nimmunopositive for CD34 and CD99 [7, 8]. To the best \nof our knowledge, the literature on superficial acral \nfibromyxoma of the palm is very limited.\nCase report presentation\nA 47-year-old East Asian woman presented with a palm \ntumor on her left knuckle that had been present for \n4  months. Four months prior to treatment, a reddish \nnodule appeared at the site due to continuous friction, \nbut the patient did not pay attention to it. Upon physical \nexamination, a pale-reddish nodule measuring approxi mately 0.8 × 0.8  cm was observed on the flexion side of Open Access\n© The Author(s) 2025.

No signs of redness, ero sion, or exudation were noted (Fig. 1).\nThe tumor was located in the dermis, without a clear \ncapsule. The stroma showed significant fibrous prolifera tion and a myxoid matrix (Fig. 2).\nThe cellular composition consisted primarily of spin dle-shaped fibroblasts, which were locally arranged in \nbundles within the stroma. The cells exhibited no evident \natypia, and sparse slender blood vessels were distributed \nalong with observed red blood cell extravasation (Fig. 3).\nThe immunohistochemistry of the tumor showed CD34 \npositivity and negativity for CD99, desmin, and epithelial \nmembrane antigen (EMA) (Fig.  4). Extensive resection \nof the mass was performed. Lesion enlargement, local \nrecurrence, or distant metastases were not detected dur ing the follow-up period.",
    "Discussion": "Discussion\nSAF was first reported by Fetch in 2001 [9]. It is \none of the solitary tissue masses that involve peri- \nand subungual acral regions [1]. The etiology and \npredisposing factors for SAF are unclear. The tumor \nis often presented as dome-shaped or verrucous with \nan average diameter of 0.6–5  cm [10]. The case we \nare reporting involves the dermis, and as Hollmann \ndiscovered, most lesions infiltrate the dermis collagen \n[1]. In terms of cytomorphology, moderately cellularproliferating spindle-shaped fibroblasts and stellate \ncells were distributed in stellate and fascicular patterns \nand embedded in a myxoid and/or collagenous \nmatrix. The matrix contained mildly and moderately \npronounced blood vessels [1]. Most cases of SAF show immunoreactivity for CD34 and CD99 and, less \nfrequently, for EMA [11]. Almost all tumors were \nnegative with S100 [11]. As for this case, tumor cells were \npositive only for CD34. One study showed that nestin is \nmore sensitive than CD34 as an immunohistochemical \nmarker in terms of identifying SAF [11]. Immunological \nmarkers indicate that the pathogenesis of SAF may be \nrelated to mesenchymal stem cells. CD34 positivity is \nnot sufficient for the diagnosis of SAF, nor is it a unique \nfeature. It requires a combination of clinical, histologic, \nand immunohistochemical features to make a diagnosis.\nTherefore, accurate diagnosis is essential for treatment \nplanning and prevention of overtreatment.\nIn one study, X-ray analysis showed that 36% of SAF \naffects bone tissue with a well-defined presentation [1]. \nFour of the 37 cases reported by Fetsch et  al. showed \ndepression or scalloping of the underlying bone [9]. \nAlthough the X-ray findings of SAF are nonspecific, \nroutine X-ray examination can help rule out some \nmalignancies.\nUltrasound can help determine the size of the lesion \nand the scope of excision, especially in distinguishing \nFig. 1 On the flexion side of the fourth metacarpophalangeal joint \nof the left hand, there was a light-red nodule about 0.8 × 0.8 cm, \nalmost round, with clear boundaries, slight keratosis on the surface, \nand a collar-like change in the periphery\nFig. 2 A photograph taken at 5× magnification \nfollowing hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The stroma shows \nsignificant fibrous proliferation and a myxoid matrix\nFig. 3 A photograph captured at 40× magnification \nafter hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. The cellular composition \nconsisted primarily of spindle-shaped fibroblasts, which were \nlocally arranged in bundles within the stroma. The cells exhibited \nno evident atypia, and sparse slender blood vessels were distributed \nalong with observed red blood cell extravasation\nPage 3 of 4\n Yang et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports           (2025) 19:13 \n \nbetween vascular and nonvascular lesions. Different \ndermoscopic findings have been reported, but the \nliterature on this subject is limited [12].\nIt should be differentiated from other myxoid tumors, \nincluding digital myxoma, ossifying fibromyxoid tumor, \nlow-grade myxofibrosarcoma, myxoid eurothekeoma, \nmyxoid nodular fasciitis, myxoid neurofibroma, \nmelanoma squamous cell carcinoma, and low-grade \nchondrosarcoma.\nNonetheless, it has been previously reported that this \nmass can lead to detachment of the underlying bone \nand impede the range of motion of the smaller joints \n[13]. Surgical excision is the most effective treatment \nfor these benign tumors [4]. Holman et al. reported that \nten patients relapsed after a mean interval of 27 months \n[1]. The average interval was 27  months [8]. One study \nshowed a recurrence rate of 13% at a follow-up of more \nthan 2 years [3].\nIf recurrence occurs, prompt excision is recommended. \nComplete excision and close follow-up are advised.\nConclusion\nSAF is a nonmalignant, slow-developing soft-tissue \ntumor that usually appears in the limbs and has distinct \nclinical and pathological characteristic findings. Our case \ndisplayed a rare case of palm involvement. Prompt and \nprecise diagnosis, followed by a thorough excision, is \nessential.\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.Author contributions\nChunli Yang wrote the draft and final versions of the manuscript and edited \nit on the basis of feedback.
