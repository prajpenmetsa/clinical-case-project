    "Background": "Background Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, previously called malignant fibrous histiocytoma, is a type \nof malignant mesenchymal tumor (sarcoma) of soft tissue and sometimes bone. It is uncommon in the oral cavity \nand very sporadic in the maxillary sinus. Microscopic diagnosis of this malignancy in the maxillary sinus can be very \nchallenging, because there is a range of features that may overlap with other benign and malignant tumors.",
    "Case Presentation": "Case presentation In this paper, we report a case of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in the maxillary sinus \nof a 61-year-old Iranian man who was referred to the maxillofacial surgery ward due to pain and swelling of the upper \njaw and visual problems in the right eye. In the initial incisional biopsy, peripheral giant cell granuloma was diagnosed in the hospital service. Yet, on request of the surgeon, during reviewing the slides in the oral pathology service \nof the School of Dentistry, and using an immunohistochemical method, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma \nwas diagnosed. In this paper, a case of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma in the maxillary sinus is reported, \nwith an emphasis on the management of its problems and diagnostic errors.",
    "Conclusion": "Conclusion This study reviews the challenges and histopathological diagnostic errors of this uncommon tumor \nin this rare location. This lesion may be similar to other malignant tumors, and its correct diagnosis requires a detailed \nand complete examination.\nKeywords Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, Malignant fibrous histiocytoma, Maxillary sinus, Diagnostic \nchallenge",
    "Introduction": "Introduction\nUndifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) is a highgrade malignancy of unknown etiology, often observed in \nsoft tissue and sometimes in bone [1]. In most cases, it \nis clinically reported as a large and usually painless lump \nin the soft tissue [2]. It often occurs in late adulthood \nand between the ages of 50 and 70 years. Its prevalence is twice as common in men than in women [1–4]. The \nodds of incidence of UPS in the cervicocephalic region, \ninvolving the sinonasal canal and craniofacial bones, lar ynx, and cervical soft tissue, are low and entail 3–10% of \ncases. This malignancy rarely involves the maxillary sinus \n[1, 3, 5]. In this paper, a case of UPS in the maxillary sinus \nis reported, with an emphasis on the management of its \nproblems and diagnostic errors [3]. The radical surgery \nof the patient was successfully performed and he was \nreferred to the relevant specialists for additional radio therapy and chemotherapy treatments.\nCase presentation\nA 61-year-old Iranian man with a complaint of slight pain \nand swelling in the upper jaw area on the right side that *Correspondence:\nFarinaz Sabaghzadegan\nfarinazsabagh@yahoo.com\n1 Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, School of Dentistry, \nShahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran\n2 Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, School of Dentistry, \nShahid Sadoughi University of Medical Sciences, Yazd, Iran\nPage 2 of 7 Tabatabaei et al.

The patient had no history \nof smoking or alcohol abuse, and there were no systemic \nproblems in his medical history.\nClinical findings\nA diffuse tender swelling of the right side of the upper jaw \nwas identified. Owing to the enlargement of the lesion, an \ninterference and disturbance was visible in closing the \nmouth and closing the right eye. In the intraoral exami nation, a soft tissue mass was observed that perforated \nanteroposterior the alveolar ridge of the right maxilla \nwith an ulcerated surface. (Fig. 1 A, B).\nDiagnostic assessment\nIn panoramic radiograph of our patient, a destructive \nradiolucent lesion was observed in the right upper jaw \nthat destroyed the sinus floor and the alveolar bone of \nthat area (Fig.  2). In examining computed tomography \n(CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radi ographs, a lesion with unclear boundaries was visible that filled the maxillary sinus and destroyed the tuberosity of \nthe maxilla and the lateral wall of the nose (Fig. 3 A, B).\nTherapeutic intervention\nThe patient underwent an incisional biopsy in the max illofacial surgery ward of the hospital and a diagnosis of \nperipheral giant cell granuloma was made. Nonetheless, \nowing to the inconsistency of this diagnosis with the \nclinical features, the patient was referred to the oral and \nmaxillofacial pathology ward at the School of Dentistry \nfor reexamination and review of the microscopic slides. \nThe patient stated that within a few days after the inci sional biopsy, the size of the swelling increased. In the \nextraoral examination, the patient appeared pale with no \nredness and swelling in the right side of the face. In the \nintraoral examination, a soft tissue mass was observed, \nwhich perforated anteroposterior the alveolar ridge of \nthe right maxilla with an ulcerated surface. In this report, \nafter confirming the diagnosis of UPS with the origin of \nthe maxillary sinus, the patient underwent a hemimax illectomy along with the removal of 5–15  mm of the \nFig. 1 Clinical view of the patient.

    "Discussion": "Discussion\nThe term malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) was first \ncoined by Ozzello et  al. [6] in 1963 and described by \nO’Brien and Stout [6] in 1964. Still, some papers have \nreported that the term MFH was first coined and pro posed by Stout (1960) as pleomorphic sarcomata of soft \ntissue, which probably originate from histocytes that \nhave the ability to be converted into fibroblasts [7]. Over \nthe next two decades, the concept of MFH was confirmed \nand considered as the most common soft tissue tumor in \nadults. Nevertheless, recent clinicopathological and \nimmunohistochemical studies showed that in most sam ples of this malignancy, tumoral fibroblasts do not origi nate from histocytes and were hence diagnosed as a \nsubgroup of other pleomorphic sarcomas [7, 8]. Fletcher \n(1992) stated in a review study that out of 159 neoplasms \ndiagnosed as MFH, only 13% could possibly be diagnosed \nas MFH. Most of these tumors were pleomorphic sub types of other sarcomas, such as liposarcoma [9]. In 2002, \nthe World Health Organization (WHO) no longer con sidered malignant fibrous histiocytoma as a distinct diag nostic category. Since then, this malignant neoplasm fell \nin a group called undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma \n[8–10]. Thus, since 2002, the term “undifferentiated pleo morphic sarcoma” replaced the old term MFH. In gen eral, sarcomata comprise approximately 1% of adult \ntumors. Approximately 80% of these tumors originate from soft tissue and the remaining 20% originate from \nbone and cartilage [8]. Moreover, less than 10% of sarco mata are found in cases of the cervicocephalic region [2]. \nMFH, which was once the most common soft tissue neo plasm in adults, now accounts for only about 5% of soft \ntissue sarcomata in adults [11]. No definitive etiology has \nyet been identified for MFH, although a history of radio therapy, bone fracture, osteonecrosis, trauma, and Paget’s \ndisease has been reported for these patients [2, 3, 12]. \nPrimary intraosseous MFH is usually detected in the \nmetaphysis of long bones of the extremities, such as the \nfemur and tibia. A review of studies showed only a few \ncases of primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma in the \nsoft tissues of the oral cavity, and only 3–10% of cases \nwere observed in the sinonasal region, larynx, soft tissue, \nand craniofacial bones [4, 13]. MFH usually occurs \nbetween the ages of 50 and 70 years, and is twice as prev alent in men than in women [2, 14]. In most cases, it has \nbeen observed clinically as a large painless lump in the \nsoft tissue [2]. In the case reported in this study, the \npatient was a 61-year-old man who had been referred due \nto swelling and slight pain in the maxillary region. On the \nbasis of some studies, the radiographic appearance of this \nlesion is usually an osteolytic lesion with an unclear mar gin and without a sclerotic margin [4]. In panoramic radi ograph of our patient, a destructive radiolucent lesion \nwas observed in the right upper jaw that destroyed the \nsinus floor and the alveolar bone of that area (Fig.  2). In \nexamining CT scans and MRI radiographs, an ill-defined \nlesion was visible that filled the maxillary sinus and \ndestroyed the tuberosity of the maxilla and the lateral \nwall of the nose (Fig.  3 A, B). On the basis of the clinical \nand radiographic views, differential diagnoses including \ncarcinomas and adenocarcinomas originating from the \nmaxillary sinus, including malignant tumors of the \nFig. 3 A Computed tomography view of coronal section, soft tissue window. B Axial section magnetic resonance imaging view of T2: a high signal \nlesion with unclear boundaries that filled the maxillary sinus, destroying the tuberosity of the maxilla and the lateral wall\nPage 4 of 7 Tabatabaei et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports           (2025) 19:17 \nperipheral salivary glands, lymphoma, and melanoma, or \nsarcomata originating from bone, cartilage, nerve, or \nmuscle in the area were proposed. Given the fullness of \nthe maxillary sinus at the time of the patient’s visit and on \nthe basis of the evidence of imaging and the short inter val that had lapsed since the formation of the intraoral \nmass as the patient stated, there was a strong possibility \nthat the lesion originated from the maxillary sinus, which \nwas also confirmed by the surgical findings. The general \nhistopathology of this lesion is often in the form of short \nclusters of spindle-shaped cells, usually arranged in a \nstoriform pattern. Multinucleated giant cells, abnormal \nmitoses, necrotic areas, and scattered histocyte-like cells \ncan be seen in the lesion context [12]. Histological sub types for MFH include: storiform/pleomorphic, myxoid, \ngiant cell, inflammatory, and angiomatoid. The most \ncommon type reported by scholars is the storiform/pleo morphic type, and the second most frequent type is the \nmyxoid type, which has a better prognosis than other \ntypes [5]. Our patient underwent an incisional biopsy by a maxillofacial surgeon, and the sample was sent to the \ngeneral pathologist for histopathology examination in the \nhospital. Owing to the observation of numerous giant \ncells in the connective tissue detected immediately in the \nsuperficial striated squamous epithelium, the diagnosis of \nperipheral giant cell granuloma was established (Fig.  4 \nA). However, the clear pleomorphism and abnormal \nmitotic forms in this sample were simply neglected (Fig.  4 \nB). Owing to the inconsistency of this diagnosis with the \nclinical features, the sample was again sent by the maxil lofacial surgeon to the oral pathology ward of the School \nof Dentistry. In the detailed histopathological examina tion of the lesion, hypercellular proliferation of abnormal \nspindle-like fibroblastic cells with hyperchromic nuclei \nand abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, along with some \npleomorphic histiocytic-like cells with vesicular nuclei \nand foamy cytoplasm with storiform arrangement (Fig.  5 \nA, B), were observed in a fibrovascular stroma with \nextensive areas of hemorrhage and extravasated erythro cytes. In the context of the lesion, abnormal mitotic \nFig. 4 A Presence of numerous giant cells in connective tissue. B Pleomorphic giant cells and mitosis\nFig. 5 Histopathological view of spindle-shaped cells with storiform design. A Image with 10× magnification. B Image with 40× magnification\nPage 5 of 7\n Tabatabaei et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports           (2025) 19:17 \n \nfigures and multinucleated giant cells were abundantly \nvisible. In addition, in the limited and superficial areas \nimmediately under the covering epithelium, pseudo-oste oid deposits with a lace-like pattern were seen (Fig.  6). In \nthis tumor type, storiform or woven growth patterns \nhave been described as elongated cells or nuclei inside \nsmall bundles with a mat (or interwoven) pattern [15]. It \nshould be noted that storiform design as an interwoven \npattern is different from a wheel-shaped or whirlwind \npattern. Owing to the different degrees of cellular pleo morphism, it is sometimes relatively difficult to diagnose \nUPS only through morphology as it may be confused \nwith other lesions; therefore, immunohistochemical \nstaining is necessary for the final diagnosis of the lesion \n[1]. In the present case, considering the possibility of ple omorphic sarcomata, immunohistochemical markers, \ncytokeratin, vimentin, CD68 antigen, S100 protein, and \ndesmin were requested. Tumoral cells were diffusely pos itive for vimentin and focally positive for CD68 antigen \n(Figs.  7, 8), but other requested markers did not show any \nactivity in the immunological lesion. Finally, these find ings were consistent with the diagnosis of an undifferen tiated pleomorphic sarcoma (or malignant fibrous \nhistiocytoma), of storiform/pleomorphic giant-cell type, \nby excluding other possible diagnoses in an exclusive \nmanner. Lawson et  al. studied ten cases of malignant \nfibrous histiocytoma and found that all of them had \nvimentin expression. In addition, six cases showed \ndesmin and neurofilament expression [16]. Yet, desmin is \nan interstitial muscle filament and its incidence is seen in \nsmooth and striated muscle cells [1]; since the desired \nlesion was negative for the desmin marker, the possibility \nof smooth and striated muscle tumors was rejected. Owing to the negativity of the cytokeratin marker, the \npossibility of pleomorphic anaplastic carcinoma was \nruled out. S100 markers were also negative in the present \nreport, thus the possibility of melanoma and pleomor phic neoplasms of nerve and fat origin was excluded [12]. \nAnother challenging diagnostic point in the present case \nwas the observation of limited areas of pseudo-osteoid \ndeposits with a lace-like pattern around the neoplastic \ncells immediately under the epithelium of the incisional \nbiopsy (Fig.  6), suggesting the possibility of an extraskele tal osteosarcoma. It should be pointed out that some \nFig. 6 Areas of osteoid deposits with a lace-like design\nFig. 7 Immunohistochemical staining for tumoral cells with vimentin \nmarker was diffusely positive (10× magnification)\nFig. 8 Immunohistochemical staining for tumoral cells with CD68 \nmarker was focally positive (10× magnification)\nPage 6 of 7 Tabatabaei et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports           (2025) 19:17 \ntypes of sarcomata can also form osteoids. Most of these \nsarcomata are seen in late adulthood and in the extremi ties, with a high histopathological grade that can be easily \ndistinguished from osteosarcoma. Some benign soft tis sue tumors that are hypercellular, mitotically active, and \nhave steroid production increase the possibility of misdi agnosing an osteosarcoma, especially in a small biopsy, \nand it is important to differentiate these cases from each \nother [17]. In the present report, osteoid deposits were \nobserved only in limited areas on the margin of the lesion \nimmediately under the epithelium, but were not present \nin other parts of the lesion in incisional and excisional \nbiopsy; therefore, the possibility of an extraskeletal osteo sarcoma was rejected and the diagnosis of a UPS with \nreactive steroid production was confirmed. Basically, \nthere are three types of treatment for malignant fibrous \nhistiocytoma: surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. \nSabesan et  al. presented the treatment management of \nmalignant fibrous histiocytoma of the head and neck as a \nchallenge due to the anatomical and functional complex ity of this area as well as the sporadic incidence of the \nlesion in this location. Furthermore, they suggested that \nthe primary surgery for this tumor in the cervicocephalic \nregion should be as radical as possible, and biopsy is nec essary for diagnosis. Radiotherapy also diminishes the \npossibility of local recurrence and has become an integral \npart of treatment; nonetheless, the role of chemotherapy \nin the treatment of this tumor is not completely clear \n[17]. Yamaguchi et al. [18] reported that the rate of local \nrecurrence in patients with adjuvant radiotherapy or \nchemotherapy combined with surgery was lower com pared with patients who underwent surgery alone. How ever, the amount of metastasis did not show much \ndisparity between them. They also stated that chemo therapy is useful for patients who have a high risk of lung metastasis. On the basis of the study conducted by Kear ney et al. [19], the rate of recurrence in surgery related to \nthis lesion was reported to be about 66% with a healthy \nmargin of more than 3 cm around the tumor, and about \n86% with a margin of less than 3 cm. In this report, after \ndiagnosis was confirmed, the patient underwent hemi maxillectomy surgery along with the removal of 15 mm \nof the healthy margin around the lesion (Fig.  9). After \nsending the sample to be frozen, negative margins around \nthe tumor were reported. The prognosis of this tumor is \nnot good and its recurrence is common; there are usually \nmetastases to the lungs, liver, and bones. Some research ers reported that 25–35% of patients with undifferenti ated pleomorphic sarcoma in the cervicocephalic region \nare involved in metastasis [12]. Factors associated with a \nfavorable prognosis in patients with malignant fibrous \nhistiocytoma include: age less than 60 years, tumor size \nless than 5  cm, superficial lesion location, low-grade \nFig. 9 Picture during surgery of the patient\nFig. 10 Clinical appearance of the patient a year after surgery.

Journal of Medical Case Reports           (2025) 19:17 \n \nmalignancy, myxoid histological subtype, and absence of \nmetastatic disease [1, 20, 21]. Follow-up with lymph node \nexamination in these patients should be performed every \n3–6 months for 2 years and then at least once a year [21]. \nThe overall survival rate after a 5-year follow-up of \npatients ranges from 30% to 74% [12]. Finally, the present \ncase was referred to relevant specialists for additional \nchemotherapy and radiotherapy treatments. A year after \nsurgery, the patient remains healthy with no recurrence \nof swelling or facial complaints (Fig. 10).\nConclusion\nUPS is an invasive mass with the ability to progress. It is \nvery rare in the maxillary sinus region and can be associ ated with many diagnostic challenges. In terms of histo pathology, this lesion may be similar to other malignant \ntumors, and its correct diagnosis requires a detailed and \ncomplete examination of the morphology and the use of \nimmunohistochemical markers to exclude other pleo morphic sarcomata.
