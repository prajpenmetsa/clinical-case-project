    "Background": "Background Malrotation of the bowel due to imperfect embryologic development is a rare condition with a wide \nspectrum of resulting anatomical variations. Similar conditions are achieved in the adult by derotating the bowel \nvia the Cattell-Braasch maneuver. However, possible preparational bias might compromise the resulting topography.",
    "Case Presentation": "Case presentation We present a case of atypical malrotation of the bowel in a cadaver study using a 96-year-old Caucasian \nmale specimen with incidental finding of the pathology post mortem with no known surgical intervention in the abdomen \nduring his lifetime. We compare the topography and abdominal layers with the anatomy of a 98-year-old Caucasian female \nspecimen where the Cattell-Braasch maneuver was used to revert the embryologic development.\nConclusions Reverting the embryologic development in the adult via Cattell-Braasch maneuver enables to mirror inherent \nmalrotation and reestablishes the position of the bowel prior to its rotation. The Cattell-Braasch maneuver is further validated \nin this study by showing that it is able to demonstrate essential layers for surgical interventions without damaging their \nintegrity. Atypical malrotation unmasks those fascial border-like layers, which are often hidden due to adhesions and fusing \nof tissue during the usual embryologic development. Developmental defects present a chance to explore essential surgical \nlayers that are otherwise masked by artifacts due to fusion of layers of connective tissue.\nKeywords  Atypical malrotation, Embryology, Cattell-Braasch maneuver, Surgical oncology, Case report\nBackground\nThe embryologic development of the gut unfolds in sev eral stages, beginning with a differentiation into foregut, \nmidgut, and hindgut in the fourth week post fertilization \n[1, 2]. The following proliferational and rotational steps \nextend from about 30 days post fertilization until the end \nof the embryonic phase [1–4]. In a first step, we encoun ter a physiological herniation of the primitive gut into the extraembryonic coelom. The first stage includes a coun terclockwise rotation of the herniated gut by 90°, result ing in a now horizontal orientation [1, 2, 4]. A further \nrotation by 180° occurs in a second step, which",

While in \n“typical” cases of malrotation the ligament of Treitz is \neither absent or located on the right side of the midline, \nin atypical malrotation the ligament of Treitz is located \non the left side of the midline and below the level of the \npyloric outlet compared with the normal anatomy [7, 8].\nAtypical malrotation has a significantly lower risk for \nthe development of a volvulus, which rationalizes not \nrushing to surgical correction but favoring a conservative \napproach in asymptomatic patients [7, 8]. This, however, \nis a simplification of a very complex decision-making \nprocess due to the plethora of anatomical variations and \nclinical considerations.\nIn this case report, we present the anatomy in a human \nspecimen in which an atypical malrotation was encoun tered in our dissection course and compare it with the \nsurgical Cattell-Braasch maneuver, which reverts the \nembryologic development by surgical derotation of the \nbowel [10, 11].\nThe method is susceptible to preparational bias, which \nleaves unanswered the question of whether the adhesions \nthat are released and the layers that are thus presented \nare valid and anatomically sound. We use this rare case \nof atypical malrotation to evaluate the Cattell-Braasch \nmaneuver and the resulting anatomy.Case presentation\nWe present the anatomy of a 96-year-old Caucasian male \nhuman specimen. For demonstrational purposes, we \nhave added images of a 98-year-old Caucasian female \nspecimen to present the Cattell-Braasch maneuver in \ndirect comparison.\nPermission for educational and scientific use at the \nInstitute of Anatomy at the University of Leipzig was \ngranted by the body donors before death in accordance \nwith the Saxonian Death and Funeral Act of 1994. The \nstudy was conducted in accordance with the Declara tion of Helsinki, and approval by the institutional review \nboard of the University of Leipzig was granted for ana tomical studies on body donations after informed con sent (project identification code 129/21-ek, date of \napproval 1/3/2022). The signed consent documents can \nbe provided by the corresponding author on reason able request. The body of the male donor was prepared \nfor our dissection course using ethanol–glycerin fixation \nwith thymol conservation [12]. The female body donor \nwas used without fixation shortly after death.\nIn our presented case, a detailed patient history is \nlacking owing to the incidental finding post mortem, \nespecially regarding recurrent abdominal symptoms. \nHowever, we did not observe any scars and encountered \nno peritoneal adhesions that might have been caused by \nsurgical intervention. The cause of death was a stroke, \naccording to the death certificate.\nFig. 1 View onto the abdominal cavity after inverted Y-incision. a Intraperitoneal anatomy after inverted Y-incision shows no pathology \nbesides diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon (not shown here) and inflammatory adhesion of the greater omentum on the gallbladder (X).

Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:548 \n \nAfter opening the abdomen with an inverted Y-inci sion, we encountered the anatomy as depicted in Fig.  1. \nThe abdominal organs showed no visible sign of tumor ous growth. The only intraabdominal pathologies that \nwere observed included diverticulosis of the sigmoid \ncolon and a cholelithiasis, which seemed to have caused \na chronic inflammation judging by the most likely inflam matory adhesion of the greater omentum onto the gall bladder (Fig. 1).\nThe small intestine was located in the right hemiab domen. The duodenum crossed the midline to the left \nand was fixated by Treitz ligaments; the duodenojeju nal loop however immediately crossed back to the right \nhemiabdomen behind the mesenteric root. The large \nintestine was located in the left hemiabdomen with the cecum in the upper-left quadrant, clearly identified by \nthe attached appendix. The parts of the large intestine \nup to the left colic flexure were mobile and attached to \nthe back wall of the abdomen via the mesenteric root. \nThe anatomy of the descending colon is consistent \nwith normal conditions with a regular fusion with the \nabdominal wall. This state prompted the diagnosis of \nan atypical malrotation of the gut with partial rotation \nof the duodenum [8 , 9]. A full view on the malrotated \nloops and the mesenteric root is given in Fig. 2 .\nAs presented in Fig.  3, shifting the bowel to the left \nside allowed free view onto the right fascia of Gerota, \nwhich sealed off the retroperitoneum.

    "Discussion": "Discussion and conclusions\nIn this case report, we present an “atypical malrota tion” of the gut with a partially rotated duodenum, \nthereby following the classification of Mehall et  al. \nand the nomenclature used by Xiong et al. [8 , 9]. Our \ncase would stem from a lack of rotation beyond the \nvery first stage, in which the primitive gut rotates 90°, \nwhich places the small intestine in the right hemiab domen and the large intestine in the left hemiabdo men. The partial “rotation” of the duodenum is caused by duodenal proliferation, which pushes it behind the \nmesenteric root and over the midline, before the duo denojejunal loop returns to the right hemiabdomen \ninstead of the usual position in the left hemiabdomen \nwithin the frame of the colon [4 , 6, 13] (Fig. 1 ).\nThis anomaly is an unusual and also invaluable find ing for manifold reasons. Firstly, the lack of rotation \nin itself—especially to the presented extent—is a rare \noccurrence. Secondly, the malrotation had no surgi cal implication during the lifetime of the body donor \ndespite the old age, providing us with an unmarred \nabdominal cavity to study. Thirdly, this anatomy vali dates the surgical Cattell-Braasch maneuver, which \nis used to derotate the bowel in the adult for the pur pose of a better overview and mobilization of the bowel \nFig. 3 View on the back wall of the abdomen. a Display of the right fascia of Gerota, confining the retroperitoneum after dislodging the small \nintestine to the left. Instrument points at the smooth fascia of Gerota. Partially rotated duodenum (arrow) crosses the midline to the left. \nc After crossing the midline, the duodenojejunal flexure (X) makes another turn and the duodenojejunal loop (*) crosses the midline \nbehind the mesenteric root to the right hemiabdomen (refer to Fig. 1b). The descending colon (***) shows no divergence from the usual \ntopography. b Display of the right fascia of Gerota after Cattell-Braasch maneuver and thereby mobilization of the ascending colon. Duodenum \nis already mobilized by Kocherization and release of the ligament of Treitz, thereby allowing a full derotation. Therefore, the duodenal \nloop is not attached to the back wall anymore and lifted off the fascia of Gerota in this image. d Similarly, since the duodenum, as well \nas the duodenojejunal flexure, was mobilized and derotated, demonstration of the left hemiabdomen after pushing the bowel to the right shows \nno duodenum or duodenojejunal loop. Descending colon (***) shows no divergence from the usual topography\nPage 5 of 6\n Alvanos et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:548 \n \nfor various surgical procedures [10]. This essentially \nreverts the embryologic development.\nWe however use the Cattell-Braasch maneuver in our \ncadaver studies to simplify the topography and enable \nus to study the remnants of the dorsal mesogastrium \nof the adult intestinal tube and fascial borders [11]. We \nfocus specifically on those borders in order to transfer \nour insights to surgical oncology. But, how does a fault ily rotated bowel help us understand fascial borders? And \nhow do those fascial borders facilitate surgical tumor \nresection?\nAs we previously described [11], our group strongly \nfavors the notion that thorough tumor resection is only \npossible if the tumor is removed along with the compart ment in which it originates. This compartment is defined \nby a common embryologic origin with an enveloping \nlayer of connective tissue. These layers enable the sur geon to preserve neighboring tissue that does not belong \nto the compartment that has to be eliminated, even if this \ntissue is in immediate vicinity to the region at risk.\nThis approach led to the creation of revolutionary",
    "Methods": "methods such as the “total mesorectal resection” (TME) \nby Heald and the “total mesometrial resection” (TMMR) \nby Höckel [14, 15].\nIn order to separate the compartments, we previously \nrevisited the Cattell-Braasch maneuver, since it enables \nthe reconstitution of the much simpler embryologic anat omy [10, 11]. By doing this and reverting adhesions, we \ncan separate layers that are merely artificially connected, \nbut not due to their mutual ontogenetic origin. These lay ers can often be separated even by blunt dissection. We \nthereby unmask fascial borders that can lead the surgeon. \nHowever, our methodology carries the risk of prepara tional bias, which in turn provokes a comprehensible \nskepticism toward the results of such study.\nTherefore, we were enthusiastic to see a situs in which \nwe can trace how the bowel would be situated prior to \na proper rotation and masking of fascial borders, which \nis exactly the state we manually restore via the CattellBraasch maneuver [11], except for the still fixed Treitz \nligament in the malrotated specimen. In Figs.  2 and 3, we \npresent an example of our Cattell-Braasch maneuver in a \ncadaver and compare it directly with the anatomy that we \nencounter in the malrotated specimen. Major analogies \nare the facilitation of the presentation of the remnants \nof the dorsal mesogastrium (Fig.  2) and the preservation \nof the fascia of Gerota as a barrier toward the retrop eritoneum (Fig.  3). The confining fascia appears entirely \nimmaculate when there is no fusion with the large intes tine. At first, the distinction between the compartment \nof the intestine and the retroperitoneum might appear \nobvious. But the demonstration of the intact surface of \nthe fascia of Gerota as in our malrotated specimens puts emphasis on the barrier that the fascia can pose. This \nrequires an approach that respects borders and facilitates \nembryologic knowledge to find the proper layer to oper ate in.",
    "Conclusion": "Conclusion\nIn this case report, we highlight an “atypical malrotation” \nfrom two angles.\nFrom a practical clinical standpoint, the presented \nanatomy can remind the clinician of pitfalls while inter preting symptoms of a patient. We want to give clinicians \nan insight into the untouched anatomy of a malrotated \nbowel. We show that knowledge in embryologic develop ment can still be relevant when encountering this incred ibly rare anomaly even in older patients.\nAdditionally, we want to use this anomaly to validate a \nparadigm shift that puts fascial borders into the spotlight \nof surgery. We consider specimens that lack developmen tal steps to be a chance to explore borders and surfaces \nthat very often vanish owing to fusion and adhesion. \nHowever, these are the borders that we deem essential \nfor successful surgery. We can thereby prove that the ana tomical conditions created in our previous studies with \nthe Cattell-Braasch maneuver are not caused by bias in \nour dissection but that the presented borders and lay ers exist in a living person and are in plain sight if not \nmasked by the normal developmental steps.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the staff of the Institute of Anatomy, who are the facilitators of the \npresented scientific work.
