    "Introduction": "Introduction\nDanish pathologist Jens Pindborg first described cal cifying epithelial odontogenic tumors (CEOT)in 1955. \nCEOT is a benign epithelial odontogenic tumor without \nectomesenchymal components. This tumor is a slowgrowing and expansile neoplasm with locally aggressive \nand invasive growth [1].CEOTs present as intraosseous lesions in most clinical \ncases. Extraosseous variants also occur in less than 5% of \ncases [2]. The peripheral type exhibits painless swelling \n[3]. This tumor is seen more frequently in the mandible \nthan in the maxilla [4]. In ~ 50% of cases, CEOT is asso ciated with a tooth, erupted or unerupted [1].\nRadiologically, central CEOT is a well-defined, unilocu lar or multilocular radiolucency. Calcified materials are \nusually found in intraosseous regions, such as scattered \nfleck calcifications [2]. A literature review of 339 cases \nrevealed that ~ 40% of peripheral CEOTs result in under lying bone resorption, and 50% of central CEOTs result \nin perforated cortical bone [5].\nThe central types usually affect premolar and molar \nareas, whereas the peripheral types are usually located *Correspondence:\nArdeshir Khorsand\nArdeshir.khorsand1374@gmail.com\n1 Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Shahid Beheshti \nUniversity of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran\n2 Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology, Shahid Beheshti \nUniversity of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran\nPage 2 of 10 Pourdanesh et al.

The patients affected by this tumor ranged in \nage from 8 to 92 years, with a mean age of 40 years. This \ntumor is found in different populations, but it has a slight \npredilection for white people [2].\nCase presentation\nIn accordance with the case report (CARE) guidelines \n[6], this report describes a patient with calcifying epithe lial odontogenic tumor by histological and radiographical \nexaminations. This patient was cured by a tooth preserv ing surgical approach in the Department of Oral and \nMaxillofacial Surgery at Taleghani General Hospital.\nChief complaints\nThe patient, a 37-year-old Iranian female, was referred \nto the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at \nTaleghani General Hospital with a chief complaint of ten derness in the anterior region of the mandible and tooth \ndisplacement in the swelling region.\nPatient information\nThe patient’s past medical history was unremarkable but \npatient mentioned a facial trauma about 20 years ago. \nThe patient also had penicillin antibiotic allergy. Patient \nreport a slow-growing mass for ~ 1 year. The familial his tory was unremarkable.\nClinical finding\nExtraoral examinations revealed a bony hard swelling ~ 3 \ncm × 4 cm in size with tenderness in the chin area.\nThe patient reported lower lip hypoesthesia along the \nright and left mental nerve branches. The lymph nodes \nwere normal with no tenderness or swelling.\nIntraorally, there was an expansile lesion with bicortical \ngrowth and displacement of teeth from tooth 25 to tooth \n22 (Fig. 1).\nThis swelling was ~ 3 cm × 4 cm in size on the buccal \nside and ~ 2 cm × 3 cm on the lingual side of the anterior \nmandible region. Tenderness and a hard bony consist ency on palpation were also noted. The oral mucosa was \nnormal and intact in color and texture. The mandibular \ncentral incisors and right mandibular lateral incisor were \nmobile in grade one, and the left mandibular lateral inci sor was mobile in grade two.\nThe inferior border of the mandible was swollen and \ntender in the lesion area.\nFistula and pus discharge were not evident in intra- and \nextra-oral examinations.\nThe patient had no symptoms of dysphagia and \ndyspnea.Vitality tests were performed by cold and electrical pul pal tests, and the",
    "Results": "results showed that the teeth adjacent \nto this lesion were vital.\nDiagnosis assessment\nPanoramic radiography revealed an expansile mixed \nradiolucent and radiopaque lesion with cortical borders \nin the anterior area of the mandible that extended from \nthe right mandibular canine to the left mandibular sec ond premolar teeth. This lytic lesion extended toward \nthe inferior border of the mandible, but the border \nwas intact. Radiopaque odontoma-like materials were \nobserved in the central part of the lesion. Cone beam \ncomputed tomography (CBCT) revealed expansion and \nperforation of the buccal and lingual plates. This lesion \nmeasured 42.6 mm to 40 mm and extended from the \nright mandibular canine to the left mandibular second \npremolar. The apical root resorption of teeth was evident \nin teeth 26, 25, 24, 23, 22, and 21 (Fig. 2).\nAn incisional biopsy was performed under local anes thesia with 2% lidocaine and 1/100,000% epinephrine.\nThe specimens were fixed in 10% formalin. Micro scopic examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained \nsamples confirmed that the tumor was a benign odonto genic tumor.\nSections showed pieces of benign odontogenic neo plasm composed of a few islands and strands of inactive \nodontogenic epithelium with juxta-epithelial hyaliniza tion in fibrous connective tissue. Mild inflammatory cells \nand some hemorrhages were also present. Hard tissue \nsections showed normal lamellar bone adjacent to the \nfibrous connective tissue. Muscle fibers and nerve bun dles were evident.\nFig. 1 Intra-oral view: bicortical swelling and displaced teeth\nPage 3 of 10\n Pourdanesh et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:526 \n \nFig. 2 A–C Panoramic and CBCT modalities showed an expansile mixed radiolucent and radiopaque lesion with cortically borders\nPage 4 of 10 Pourdanesh et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:526 \nAn aspiration of 1.5 cc of red fluid was conducted using \nan 18-gauge needle. The smear showed many red blood \ncells (RBCs) and scattered inflammatory cells in an eosin ophilic background material.\nTherapeutic intervention\nThe patient underwent surgery to remove the lesion \nunder general anesthesia.\nA sulcular incision with releasing incisions was made \nfrom the right first molar to the left first molar. After \nsubperiosteal dissection, perforation of the buccal plate \nwas present. To access the lesion, the remaining thin \ncortical bone was removed by a green stick fracture. The \nlesion was separated from the bone walls and ultimately completely removed (Fig.  3). Curettage of the bone adja cent to the tumor was conducted to reduce the risk of \nrecurrence. The defect was simultaneously augmented \nwith the remaining intact buccal cortex bone. The defect \nsite was filled with Gelfoam (Pfizer company, USA) and \ncovered with resorbable membrane (Fig.  4), and the inci sion lines were sutured watertight by vicryl 4–0.\nThe tumors were stored in 10% formalin for histo pathological analysis.\nFollow up and outcomes\nThe surgery was uneventful, and the wound healed with out complications.\nFig. 2 continued\nPage 5 of 10\n Pourdanesh et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:526 \n \nMicroscopic examination revealed an odontogenic \nneoplasm of islands, strands, and sheets of polyhedral \nepithelial cells in a fibrous stroma. The cellular out lines of epithelial cells were distinct. Multiple concen tric Liesegang ring calcifications were observed. Nests \nof odontogenic epithelium in fibrous connective tissue \nand disorganized dentin and cementum were also evi dent. Scattered chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, muscle fiber sections, nerve bundles, adipose tissue, \nextracted RBCs, reactive bone, and hemorrhage were \nalso evident. There was no evidence of malignancy \n(Figs. 5 , 6). \nClinical, radiographical, and histopathological find ings suggested a diagnosis of a combined odontogenic \ntumor that consisted of an epithelial odontogenic \ntumor and an odontoma.\nDuring the 6-month follow-up, the displaced teeth of \nthe anterior mandible were arranged as before without \nany additional treatment (Fig. 7 ).\nThe follow-up panoramic radiograph showed new \nbone formation in the peripheral wall of the defect. \nCBCT revealed a radiolucency, ~  13 mm ×  17 mm in \nsize on the lingual side of the mandible, which indi cates a lack of bone formation at the time of follow-up \n(Fig. 8 ).\nVitality tests by cold and electrical pulpal tests at the \n6-month follow-up showed that the teeth involving adja cent lesions were vital.\nNo recurrence was observed in the first 12 months of \nfollow-up.",
    "Discussion": "Discussion\nCEOT is a benign odontogenic tumor that accounts \nfor ~  1% of all odontogenic tumors. This tumor usually \naffects adults, with a peak of occurrence between the \nages of 35 and 60 years. The subject patient was within \nthis range.\nApproximately 50% of the case reports of CEOT are \nassociated with a tooth impacted and/or displaced by the \ntumor.\nCEOT commonly occurs in the posterior jaw with \nassociated cortex discontinuity.\nThe recurrence rate of CEOT is reported to be \n~ 10–15%. Malignant transformation is very rare [7]. The \ntissue origin of CEOT remains controversial. Pindborg \nsuggested that it originated from the retracted enamel \nepithelium of the embedded teeth. However, the tumor \ncells are similar to those in the middle layer of the enamel \norgan. Hence, most scholars believe it comes from the \nmiddle layer cells of the enamel organ [3].\nCEOTs present either intraosseous or extraosseous \nlesions. It more frequently occurs in the posterior sites of \nthe mandible and is often associated with an unerupted \ntooth. This tumor manifests as painless and slow-growing \nFig. 3 A The perforated cortical bone is seen. B the lesion \nafter complete excision\nPage 6 of 10 Pourdanesh et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:526 \nswelling. The patient in this case study experienced prac tically painless swelling for ~ 1 year.\nRadiographically, these lesions may have different fea tures according to age. The mature lesions that display \nunilocular or multilocular radiolucency with radiopaque \nmaterial are referred to as driven snow. The immature \nlesions are more radiolucent. Radiographically, the bor ders of tumors are usually well circumscribed but may \nhave irregular borders [8].There are several jaw lesions with similar features to \nCEOT in radiographic views.\nThe most frequent jaw masses that may be appear as \nmultilocular lesions are ameloblastoma and odontogenic \nkeratocysts (OKC).\nAmeloblastoma is a benign odontogenic tumor with a \nlocally aggressive growth and strong tendency for recur rence [9]. CEOT is thought to exhibit less aggressive \ngrowth pattern comparison to ameloblastoma [3].\nFig. 4 The defect was simultaneously augmented with the remaining intact buccal cortex bone (A). The defect site was filled with Gelfoam (B) \nand covered with resorbable membrane (C)\nPage 7 of 10\n Pourdanesh et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:526 \n \nWorld health organization categorized OKS as a neo plasm due to destructive growth pattern and high fre quent recurrences. One study reported the recurrence \nrate of OKC 9% to 60% according to the surgical approach [10] while Chrcanovic et al., reported the recurrence rate \nof CEOT of 12.6% [5].\nIn the patient, the lesion had mixed radiolucency and \nradiopacity. The radiopaque material appeared as a com plex odontoma on the central side of the lesion. Radio graphical examination revealed that the border of the \nlesion was well defined and that apical root resorption \nwas considerable.\nHybrid odontogenic tumors consist of two or more \nodontogenic tumors that occur at the same site. The most \ncommon of these tumors are calcifying odontogenic \ncysts associated with odontoma, followed by central \nodontogenic fibroma with central giant cell granuloma, \nadenomatoid odontogenic tumors (AOT) with calcifying \nepithelial odontogenic tumor, AOT with dentigerous cyst \n(DC), and DC with odontoma.\nRadiographical and histopathological examinations \nconfirmed that the tumor in our study consisted of a \nCEOT and odontoma. The recurrence of hybrid tumors \nafter nonaggressive surgical approaches is uncommon, \nand the prognosis of hybrid tumors is good [11].\nCEOT leads to the displacement of adjacent teeth, \nwhich is often the first clinical sign. Despite the displace ment, there is no evidence of tooth loosening [12]. In this \npatient, the anterior mandibular teeth were displaced and \nFig. 5 A, B Photomicrograph showing an odontogenic neoplasm of sheets of polyhedral epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm \nand inter cellular bridges. Multiple concentric calcifications (Liesegang ring) are seen [hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining, × 100, × 400, A, B]\nFig. 6 Photomicrograph showing irregular tubular dentin (A), \npre dentin (B), and incremental line(C) (H & E staining, × 400)\nPage 8 of 10 Pourdanesh et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:526 \nmobile, but the vitality tests were positive. The patient \nwas scheduled for strict follow-up. After 6 months, the \ndisplaced teeth were arranged naturally without addi tional treatment, such as root canal therapy or ortho dontic treatment. The treatment plan for CEOT ranges \nfrom enucleation and curettage to radical and extensive \nresection. The appropriate surgical approach is based on \nthe clinical manifestations and histopathological features \n[13]. Patient age and tumor location are other considera tions for a suitable surgical plan [12].\nSpecifically, CEOT exhibits distinctive morphologi cal features, such as clusters of floating tumor cells \nor clumps of cells. The histological manifestations of “classic” CEOT include masses of polyhedral epithe lial cells with clear cell borders, nuclear pleomorphism, \nand minimal mitotic activity. Mitoses and nuclear pleo morphisms are highly uncommon. The matrix typically \nappears to be myxoid or myxoid with calcified islands, \nsometimes showing concentric or sandy calcifications. \nAmyloid deposition is another hallmark of CEOT, \nalthough the origin of this homogeneous material \nremains debated [14].\nAn ultrastructural study of CEOT by Page et  al. \nrevealed that amyloid is a protein product of enamel \norgans that is distinct from endocrine-related or sys temic amyloid. Congo red staining demonstrated green \nFig. 7 A Pre operative view. B and C Follow up examination after 6 months. Notice the arranged teeth in C \nPage 9 of 10\n Pourdanesh et al.

Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:526 \nbirefringence of amyloid deposits in CEOT, aiding in its \ndifferentiation from other lesions [15].\nFurthermore, El-Labban et al. proposed that the amy loid protein in CEOT is the result of breakdown of the \ngel-like substance secreted by tumor epithelial cells \n[16].\nAccording to the WHO 2022 study, the classification \nhas undergone significant changes and is divided into \nthe following categories:\n• clear cell CEOT\n• cystic/microcystic CEOT\n• noncalcifying/Langerhans cell-rich CEOT [17].\nIn this patient, the inferior border of the mandi ble was intact. Enucleation with curettage was chosen \nas the optional treatment plan. After excision of the \nlesion, the remaining bone of the buccal cortex was \nused to reconstruct the defect.\nConclusion\nThis case demonstrated the use of a less aggressive \nsurgical approach for treating CEOT. By this surgi cal approach, without any tooth extraction, the teeth \nwere functional and vital in the oral cavity without any \nmobility.\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.\nAuthor contributions\nConception: Fereydoun Pourdanesh.
