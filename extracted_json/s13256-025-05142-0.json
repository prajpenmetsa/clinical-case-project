    "Introduction": "Introduction\nInguinal hernias occur rarely in females, in around less \nthan 5% of women [1]. Female inguinal hernia is relatively \nless common than in men. Almost all hernias occur ring in females are of the indirect type. The incidence of \ninguinal hernia in females is 1.9%, with the ratio of men \nto women being 6:1 [2]. Female inguinal hernia is of \nthe congenital type and may go unnoticed until old age \nor complications occur. Incomplete obliteration of the \nprocessus vaginalis causes a canal of Nuck or indirect \ninguinal hernia in females [3]. In adult women, indirect \nhernias are more common than direct hernias and typi cally occur in individuals aged 40–60 years [4].\nThe presentation is usually painless swelling in the \ngroin. Normally, the hernia sac is solitary, with omentum as its content. Rarely, more than one indirect sac is pre sent in female indirect inguinal hernia. Diagnosis is \nclinically or radiologically difficult for confirming more \nthan one indirect sac. Most cases are diagnosed intra operatively. The individual ligation of sacs or excision of \nthe canal of Nuck is the recommended treatment in the \ncase of more than one sac in an indirect type of ingui nal hernia.The case report of “the Srinagar” hernia is \nbeing reported owing to the uniqueness of occurrence of \ntwo sacs with a single canal of Nuck in a female indirect \ninguinal hernia.\nCase report\nA 64-year-old female of Kashmiri ethnicity reported \nwith right groin swelling for 4  years.There was gradual \nincrease of its size in the oblique direction of the groin. \nShe had hypothyroidism, hypertension, diabetes, and \nchronic bronchitis and was on levothyroxine, telmisar tan/amlodipine, a combination of metformin/glimepir ide, and bronchodilators.

General physical examination was \nunremarkable. Systemic exam was normal. On abdomi nal examination, there were port site scars from the \nlaparoscopic cholecystectomy and a lower abdominal \ntransverse scar from the open hysterectomy present. On \nlocal examination of the right groin, she had groin swell ing of a pyriform shape reaching up to the labia, which \nwas soft, expansile on cough impulse, non-tender, and \nreducible (Fig.  1). Ultrasound of the abdomen confirmed \ndiagnosis of right indirect inguinal hernia.\nThe patient had open surgery, with perioperative \nfindings revealing a long sac crossing the pubic symph ysis. (Fig.  2). The hernia sac was thick and wide (Fig.  3). The deep ring was slightly dilated. The round ligament \nwas thinned out into a fibrous cord and was preserved. \nOn dissection of this long thick sac, three sacs were \nfound, and each of the sacs was adhered together by \nfilmy adhesions. The two sacs, being laterally placed, \nwere of an indirect type, having their own fundus, body, \nand neck, with each sac opening separately into the \nperitoneal cavity (sac 1 and sac 2). The medial sac was \nconfirmed as a canal of Nuck (sac 3), with no communi cation with the peritoneal cavity and the content being \nclear fluid (Fig.  4). One indirect sac contained omen tum as its content, and the second one contained intes tine as its content. These two sacs of indirect hernia \ntype were released from flimsy adhesions to each other \nand from the canal of Nuck. Both sacs of indirect type \nwere ligated individually after transfixation and repos ited back into the peritoneal cavity. The canal of Nuck \nwas excised after ligation. Onlay mesh was placed. The \nfollow-up period was uneventful.\nFig. 1 Groin swelling from a right-sided female inguinal hernia\nFig. 2 Gross appearance of the indirect sac of female inguinal hernia\nFig. 3 Large thick sac of indirect female inguinal hernia\nFig. 4 Two indirect sacs (sac 1 and sac 2) and a canal of Nuck (sac 3) \non medial side of indirect female inguinal hernia\nPage 3 of 5\n Wani  Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2025) 19:110",
    "Discussion": "Discussion\nThe lifetime risk in women of developing a groin hernia is \nreported as being 3–5.8% [5]. Older age, family history of \ninguinal hernia, connective tissue disorders, and physi cal activities leading to an increase in intra-abdominal \npressure are predisposing factors for the development \nof groin hernia in women [6]. It is noteworthy to men tion that smoking, appendectomy, abdominal surgeries, \nor multiple deliveries are not considered risk factors for \nthe occurrence of inguinal hernias in females, unlike in \nmales, where these are predisposing factors for inguinal \nhernia [5, 7]. In 1973, Glassow reported that direct ingui nal hernias in women are “so rare that a primary inguinal \nhernia is considered to be indirect until proven other wise” [8]. This is attributed to the presence of stronger \ntransversalis fascia in the floor of the inguinal canal, \nbearing the stress of pregnancy and acting as a protec tive measure to prevent the occurrence of direct hernia \n[9]. It is assumed that the fascia transversalis, along with \nthe ligamentum rotundum, is thinned out because of the \nhydrocele, mimicking a direct hernia in adults [7].\nThe female inguinal hernia is to be considered a con genital anomaly secondary to a failure of obliteration of \nthe processus vaginalis [10]. During embryogenesis, the \nround ligament of the uterus drags a small evagination \nof parietal peritoneum through the internal ring into the \ninguinal canal in females. This small evagination of pari etal peritoneum is known as the canal of Nuck in females, \nwhich is akin to the processus vaginalis in males. This \n“cyst of the canal of Nuck” was first documented in 1691 \nby the Dutch anatomist Anton Nuck van Leiden [11]. \nThe canal of Nuck normally obliterates in a craniocaudal \ndirection between month 8 of gestation and the first year \nof life. Failure to accomplish complete obliteration of this \nperitoneal evagination",
    "Results": "results in canal of Nuck or an indi rect sac of hernia [12]. A patent peritoneal evagination is \na precursor for an indirect inguinal hernia. The processus \nvaginalis may be partially obliterated at the proximal end \nonly, while leaving the distal aspect intact, resulting in \nthe formation of a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck. These \ncanal of Nuck hydroceles are more often seen in children, \nbut there is an increasing number of documented cases \nreported in adults [13–15].\nIt should be noted that a cyst of canal of Nuck is differ ent from an inguinal hernia sac in that it contains fluid \ninstead of adipose tissue or intestine, and it is not con nected to the peritoneal cavity [16].\nHydrocele of the canal of Nuck is defined as a col lection of fluid within the processus vaginalis in \nfemales and is equivalent to a hydrocele of the sper matic cord [17]. It typically presents as inguinal swell ing that extends to the labia major during the Valsalva \nmaneuver and does not usually enlarge in size, which differentiates it from an inguinal hernia. If the mass is \nlarge enough and not reducible, it might be transillumi nated to reveal its contents. A cyst of the canal of Nuck \nis frequently misdiagnosed as inguinal hernia in females \nand is only correctly diagnosed intraoperatively.\nOn the basis of fluid distension, the canal of Nuck \nhydrocele is divided into three types [10].\nType 1 is called a cyst of the canal of Nuck, also \nknown as a noncommunicating or cystic hydrocele. \nThis type of cyst is the most common type of hydrocele \nof canal of Nuck. There is no communication between \nthe hydrocele and peritoneal cavity, and the caudal por tion of the canal remains open while the cranial por tion is occluded. It mostly appears as an encysted mass \nwithout hernia defect. This occlusion progresses from \nthe deep to the superficial inguinal ring, and fluid accu mulates in the canal, leading to the development of a \ncyst. A cystic dilation may be caused by a discrepancy \nbetween the absorption and secretion of fluid, an alter ation in lymphatic drainage, trauma, or infection, or it \nmay be idiopathic [18].\nType 2 is known as a communicating hydrocele. A \ntype 2 cyst is a communicating hydrocele characterized \nby its continuity with the peritoneal cavity. As a result, \nthe size and shape of the cyst may change during the \nValsalva maneuver or standing [19].\nType 3, also called the combined type, is a bilocular \nhydrocele. It comprises two cysts: one is an encysted \npart that does not communicate with the peritoneal \ncavity, while the other part communicates with the \nperitoneal cavity, forming an hourglass swelling. This \nbilocular appearance is caused by a narrow, deep ingui nal ring that allows only partial closure [20].\nClinically, a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck may \nappear as a painless or uncomfortable fluctuating ingui nal lump with no accompanying nausea or vomiting. \nAccording to an analysis of 105 cases, a hydrocele of \nthe canal of Nuck most frequently develops on the right \nside, and it is typically nontender, nonreducible, and \nmobile [21]. This canal of Nuck may coexist with multi loculations diagnosed on radiology. These multilocula tions are usually present in pediatric cases within the \ncanal of Nuck [22]. Multiloculations are thin, septate, \nsmall, very fragile, and always multiple, existing in dif ferent planes. In addition, they are easily separable and \ndo not open in the peritoneal cavity.\nIn the case of “the Srinagar” hernia, two individual \nindirect sacs were found with all the parts of a typical \nhernia sac and solitary canal of Nuck present. It was \nprobably of congenital origin, as indirect hernias are \nalmost always of congenital origin. The third sac was \ntype 1 cyst of canal of Nuck in the case of “the Srina gar” hernia.\nPage 4 of 5 Wani  Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2025) 19:110 \nThe contents of female inguinal hernia are varied \nabdominal viscera and mostly contain omentum or intes tine. Rarely, in 3% of female inguinal hernia cases, ovaries \nor fallopian tubes may be seen as contents [23, 24]. The \novary or fallopian tube may get entrapped and misdiag nosed as an incarcerated or strangulated hernia deemed \nas an indication for emergency surgery [25]. Lack of \nawareness of occurrence of complications of female \ninguinal hernia with known risk factors often leads to \nreluctance in seeking consultation and increases the risk \nof complications.\nA diagnosis of hernia has a correlation with age in \nfemales [26]. After an initial peak of easy diagnosis in \ninfants, groin hernias become more prevalent with \nadvancing age [27]. Following the same trend of bimodal \ndistribution, complications such as incarceration, stran gulation, or obstructed hernia are observed at the peaks \nof age. The majority of cases of female inguinal hernia \nare diagnosed solely on the basis of a clinical history and \nexamination. This may present as an asymptomatic find ing or present as a painless bulge in the groin. Hernias \nmay frequently be overlooked, particularly if not assessed \nduring a physical examination. The low incidence of \ngroin hernias in patients with a higher body mass index \nprobably carries a risk of bias since it is easier to detect \nan inguinal hernia at a lower body mass index [28]. Most \nhydroceles of canal of Nuck are diagnosed intraopera tively owing to very low clinical suspicion. Sometimes \nultrasound is performed to narrow down the differential \ndiagnosis [29]. The standard treatment is complete exci sion of the hydrocele via open surgery with mesh herni oplasty. Laparoscopic excision by the transabdominal \npreperitoneal (TAPP) and totally extraperitoneal (TEP) \napproaches are being done in female inguinal hernia.\nConclusion\nFemale inguinal hernias usually contain a single sac. \nOccurrence of two indirect sacs and a single canal of \nNuck in an individual female indirect inguinal hernia is \nextremely rare.\nAcknowledgements\nNone.\nAuthor contributions\nThe author had the idea for the research and edited and approved the final \nmanuscript.
