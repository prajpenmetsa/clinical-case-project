Intraspinal hematoma or subarachnoid hemorrhage \ndue to a schwannoma stroke is extremely rare. How ever, patients often have severe spinal cord compression \nsymptoms that require emergency surgery. However, the \nmechanism underlying the bleeding remains unclear. \nThis case describes a patient with an intraspinal schwan noma that presented with breakage and bleeding of the \nspinal nerve root, intratumoral congestion, tumor enve lope rupture and bleeding, and intraspinal hematoma. In addition, we review studies on spinal schwannoma hem orrhage and explore the mechanisms of bleeding.\nCase presentation\nInformed consent was obtained from the patient. We \npresent the case of a 53-year-old Chinese female who \nhad no chronic diseases. The patient was hospitalized for \nsurgical treatment of a lumbar disc herniation in Novem ber 2022. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a \nspace-occupying lesion in the spinal canal at T12 meas uring 1  cm × 1  cm × 1 cm (Fig.  1). The lesion was not \ntreated further at that time. Fifty days before admission, \nthe patient suddenly experienced pain in both lower \nlimbs after long-distance running. The pain was mild, \ntolerable, and relieved with painkillers. On 13 April 2023, \nthe pain suddenly increased and became unbearable. \nLumbar MRI showed that the spinal canal at T12–L1 was \noccupied, with a 2 cm × 2 cm × 3 cm T11–L1 intraspinal Open Access\n© The Author(s) 2024.

    "Discussion": "Discussion\nIntraspinal schwannoma hemorrhage is rare and may \npresent as an intratumoral hemorrhage, subarachnoid \nhemorrhage, or both. To explore the mechanism under lying the bleeding, we reviewed the literature published \nover the past 30 years and found 23 cases of intraspi nal schwannoma hemorrhage, summarized in Table  1 [2–23]. Among all patients, 9 (39.1%) occurred in the cer vical spine, 8 (34.8%) in the cauda equina, and 17 (73.9%) \nin the craniocervical, cervicothoracic, or thoracolumbar \njoints. Nine patients (39.1%) had definite induction of \nspinal movement before bleeding. Five patients had only \nsubarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Four patients experi enced only intratumoral bleeding. Seven patients experi enced both SAH and intratumoral bleeding. Among the \npatients, 3 had clear tumor capsule rupture and bleeding, \nand 18 had intact and unbroken tumor capsules. In addi tion, three patients experienced nerve root injury, includ ing torsion, rupture, and drainage vein bleeding.\nTwo main theories have been proposed to explain the \nmechanisms of spinal schwannoma hemorrhage. First is \nFig. 6 The tail of the tumor is tightly connected to the nerve root (triangle). On the rostral part, the breakage of the tumor capsule was visualized \n(arrow)\nFig. 7 A The tumor is reddish brown in the whole body. The breakage of the tumor capsule (arrow) was apparent. After longitudinal sectioning, \ndiffuse congestion and edema were seen in the tumor. B, C  Hematoxylin and eosin staining at 100 × magnification showed a tumor dominated \nby loose cells, many dilated blood vessels (arrow), and many intravascular red blood cells (arrow). No necrotic tissue was found\nPage 5 of 7\n Shen et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:633 \n \nthe vascular theory, where the proliferative and dilated \nblood vessels of tumors may cause spontaneous throm bus formation. The distal end of the thrombus can cause \ntumor necrosis and bleeding [3]. No histological signs \nof necrosis were found in our case. Although bleeding \nmay be a common finding in schwannoma histology, \nnecrosis has not been observed in any other case report \n[2–23]. Moreover, the vascular theory does not explain \nthe pathogenesis in patients with SAH and without \nintratumoral hemorrhage. In the longitudinal section of \nthe gross specimen, we saw that the tumor was dark red \nthroughout, with diffuse congestion and swelling rather \nthan local necrosis and bleeding. Similar pathological \nspecimens have been previously reported [14, 16, 19]. \nFurthermore, on pathological examination, the tumor \ncells were relatively sparse but rich in dilated blood ves sels and intravascular red blood cells. Similar histol ogy has been reported in other cases [3, 5, 8, 19, 20, 22]. \nTherefore, we believe that the pathological type of bleed ing within a schwannoma is congestion caused by venous \nobstruction rather than bleeding.\nThe other proposed theory to explain spinal schwan noma hemorrhage is the mechanical theory. The location of the tumor is vital for hemorrhage, especially in the \ncauda equina and cervical vertebra [11]. Excessive move ment between the tumor and spinal cord attachment \nproduces traction, destroying the fragile vascular struc ture on the surface, leading to subarachnoid hemorrhage. \nWe believe this explanation is reasonable. We observed \na rupture of the tumor-bearing nerve root during sur gery, and other cases have reported torsion of the nerve \nroot [16] and venous bleeding drainage [22]. This the ory also supports our statistical results, in which 39.1% \nof the patients had a clear inducement of spinal move ment before bleeding. The rate of bleeding in males is \nslightly higher than in females. The proportion of bleed ing occurring in the cervical vertebrae, cauda equina, and \nspinal junction area is relatively higher, possibly related \nto increased movement. Owing to the effect of gravity \non the tumor, repeated pulling and dragging from the \ntumor during movement may damage the carrier nerve \nroot and its blood vessels, even causing a rupture of the \nnerve root, which leads to SAH. Degenerative changes in \nthe spine can exacerbate the injury [14]. Similarly, tumor \nmovement may cause distortion or rotation of the nerve \nroots. Blood supply to the tumor comes entirely from Table 1 Summary of the cases of spinal schwannomas with intraspinal hemorrhage in the last 30 years\nM male, F female, C cervical, T thoracic, L lumber, NR not reported, SAH subarachnoid hemorrhageAuthor, year Country Age Gender Site of tumor SAH Intratumoral hemorrhage Inducing factor\nChalif et al.  1990 America 56 F C1–2 Yes NR NR\nMills et al.  1993 New Zealand 53 M C7-T1 Yes Yes NR\nBarquero et al.  1994 Spain 68 M C5–7 Yes NR NR\nCorriero et al.  1996 Italy 37 M C7–T1 Yes NR Physical stress\nUemura et al.  1998 Japan 58 F T11–L2 No Yes NR\nCordan et al.  1999 Turkey 28 F L1–2 Yes NR NR\nCohen et al.  2000 Israel 52 M L1 Yes Yes (rupture of capsule) Fall from a ladder\nNg.2001 Singapore 43 NR C6–7 Yes Yes (rupture of capsule) NR\nParmar et al.  2004 Singapore 56 M T11–L1 Yes No NR\nCiappetta et al.  2008 Italy 44 F C2 Yes Yes NR\nJi et al.  2010 Korea 44 M C1–2 Yes No Sneezing\nSun et al.  2010 China 32 M T4–5 Yes NR Sneezing\nKukreja et al.  2014 America 47 M L1–2 Yes Yes Seizure episode\nBennett et al.  2015 America 66 F L4 Yes No NR\nJenkins et al.  2015 America 62 M L2–3 No Yes (nerve root torsion) NR\nZhang et al.  2016 China 47 F T9 Yes No Cough\nTanki et al.  2018 India 11 F T11–L1 Yes NR NR\nGandhoke et al.  2018 India 38 F C2–4 No Yes NR\nDobran et al.  2019 Italy 38 M T11 Yes Yes Car accident\nSingh et al.  2020 India 35 F C3–T3 No Yes NR\nChen et al.  2021 China 45 M T2 Yes NR (nerve root bleeding) Hard physical work\nZhang et al.  2022 China 40 M L3 Yes No No\nThis case 2023 China 53 F T12–L1 Yes Yes (rupture of cap sule and nerve root rupture)Long-distance running\nPage 6 of 7 Shen et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:633 \nthe bidirectional supply of vessels that run through the \ntumor carrier nerve roots. The rotation of a schwannoma \ncan cause twisting of blood vessels. Because of the higher \npressure of the arterial blood vessels, the impact of the \nvascular kink is relatively small, resulting in the occlusion \nof drainage veins, leading to diffuse congestion and swell ing of the tumor. This is similar to the effect of drainage \nvein blockage during arteriovenous malformation resec tion. In severe cases, tumor capsule rupture and bleeding \nmay occur.\nIn summary, we conclude that three important pro cesses are involved in the occurrence of hemorrhage in \nspinal schwannoma: (1) injury and bleeding of the car rier nerve root and its vessels during tumor motion, (2) \ntumor carrier nerve root torsion, twisting, and venous \nobstruction, and (3) tumor congestion and swelling with \ncapsule rupture and bleeding in severe cases (Fig. 8).\nWe believe that early surgery should be performed \nto treat schwannoma hemorrhages. Surgical treatment \nshould be performed once a diagnosis is made. Hemato mas should be removed as soon as possible, and tumors \nshould be completely resected. This course of action will \nrelieve the compression of the spinal cord and nerves \ncaused by tumors and hematomas, minimizing the dys function and nerve root stimulation symptoms caused by \ncompression. For an accurate diagnosis and correspond ing treatment, it is necessary to fully understand the pathogenesis and pathological processes of schwannoma \nhemorrhage.\nConclusion\nInjury to tumor carrier nerve roots and vessels during \nmotion, nerve root torsion, twisting, venous obstruction, \ntumor congestion and swelling, and capsule rupture are \nimportant in spinal schwannoma hemorrhage processes. \nEarly diagnosis and proactive surgery are critical for \ntreatment.\nAcknowledgements\nWe acknowledge all of the clinical staff at Department of Neurosurgery II of \nthe First Affiliated Hospital of Henan University of Science and Technology, \nChina, for the successful management of this patient; without the efforts of \nthe whole team, a good outcome would not have been achieved.\nAuthor contributions\nZhe She: clinical data collection, writing—draft preparation, literature search. \nHaoyang Chen: literature search and organization.
