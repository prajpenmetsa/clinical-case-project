    "Background": "Background Tropheryma whipplei pneumonia is an infrequent medical condition. The clinical symptoms associated \nwith this disease are nonspecific, often resulting in misdiagnosis or missed diagnosis. Therefore, sharing and summarizing the experiences in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease can deepen global understanding and aware ness of it.",
    "Case Presentation": "Case presentation The patient is a 78-year-old married Han Chinese female who was admitted to the hospital \nafter experiencing fever, dry cough, and fatigue for 4 days. A lung computed tomography scan revealed inflammatory exudation in the lower left lung, accompanied by pleural effusion. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was sub jected to further analysis using metagenomic next-generation sequencing, which identified 41 genetic sequences \nassociated with Tropheryma whipplei. Consequently, she was diagnosed with Tropheryma whipplei pneumonia. After \ninitiating treatment with doxycycline and biapenem, the patient’s symptoms showed significant improvement. \nUpon discharge, the patient continued treatment with a combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine, which \nwas discontinued after 4 days. At 12-month follow-up, the patient reported overall good health, with no symptoms \nof fever, cough, or any other discomfort.",
    "Conclusion": "Conclusion Tropheryma whipplei pneumonia is a rare condition with nonspecific symptoms. The application \nof metagenomic next-generation sequencing technology in pulmonary infections helps to rapidly identify rare \npathogens, providing a solid foundation for precise and effective antibacterial treatment for patients.\nKeywords  Tropheryma whipplei, Whipple’s disease, Pneumonia, Case report",
    "Introduction": "Introduction\nWhipple’s disease is a rare multisystem chronic con dition with an incidence of less than 1 in 1,000,000 [1]. \nFirst described by George Whipple in 1907, the disease \nwas initially believed to stem from a metabolic disorder \nowing to observed abnormalities in the digestive tract. \nHowever, with the advent of effective antibiotics and \nadvancements in electron microscopy, it was later con firmed to be a bacterial infection. It was not until 2000 \nthat the causative bacterium, Tropheryma whipplei, was \nsuccessfully cultured [2, 3]. Tropheryma whipplei is a rodshaped, Gram-positive bacterium, measuring approxi mately 2  µm in length and 0.25–0.5  µm in diameter. It Open Access\n© The Author(s) 2024.

Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:613 \npossesses a distinctive three-layered cell wall ultras tructure, as observed under electron microscopy, and is \nrecognized as one of the slowest-growing human patho gens, with a generation time of approximately 18 days [4]. \nClassic Whipple’s disease primarily affects the gastroin testinal tract, presenting with diarrhea and weight loss \n[3]. In recent years, cases of chronic localized and acute \ninfections caused by this pathogen have been reported, \nincluding endocarditis, pulmonary infections, and ocu lar uveitis [5–7]. These new manifestations differ from \nthe classical symptoms of Whipple’s disease and are \nmore likely to lead to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. \nTropheryma whipplei can cause either infection or colo nization. In this case report, we describe a pulmonary \ninfection caused by Tropheryma whipplei in an elderly \nfemale patient who presented with fever and a dry cough. \nChest computed tomography (CT) revealed infectious \nlesions, but microbial cultures of sputum, blood, and \nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) did not yield any \nidentifiable pathogens. Fortunately, through next-genera tion metagenomic sequencing, we successfully identified \nTropheryma whipplei in the BALF. Following targeted \nantimicrobial therapy, the patient’s condition improved, \nleading us to classify this as an infection rather than mere \ncolonization. Furthermore, given the limited reports on \nTropheryma whipplei pneumonia in both domestic and \ninternational literature, we conducted a retrospective \nanalysis to enhance healthcare professionals’ understand ing of this disease.\nCase presentation\nThe patient is a 78-year-old married Han Chinese woman \nwho was admitted to the hospital with a fever, dry cough, \nand fatigue lasting 4 days. She developed a fever 4 days \nprior, reaching a maximum temperature of 39.9  °C, \naccompanied by paroxysmal dry cough, fatigue, and thigh \nmuscle pain, without any chest tightness or pain. On the third day of her illness, she visited a local hospital, where \na computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed \ninflammatory exudate in the left lower lung along with \npleural effusion (Fig.  1A). Despite receiving empirical \nantiinfective treatment with moxifloxacin and oseltamivir \nphosphate, she continued to experience fever. During her \nillness, her mental state and appetite declined compared \nwith her baseline health. The patient has a history of cer ebral infarction and has been taking atorvastatin calcium \ntablets long-term. Additionally, she has a history of anxi ety, for which she has been receiving ongoing treatment \nwith haloperidol and melitracen. She also has a history of \ndrug allergies, specifically to cephalosporins, penicillins, \nand azithromycin. There were no notable abnormalities \nreported in her personal, marital, or menstrual history, \nnor in her family history.\nUpon admission, the patient’s body temperature \nwas 37.8  °C, with a heart rate of 103 beats per min ute and a respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute. \nHer blood pressure was recorded at 136/68  mmHg \n(1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa). She appeared to be in poor men tal state. Physical examination revealed a soft neck with \nno palpable enlargement of superficial lymph nodes. Aus cultation of the lungs showed weak breath sounds bilat erally, but no significant rales were noted. The heart rate \nremained at 103 beats per minute, with a regular rhythm, \nand no murmurs were detected in any of the valve areas. \nThe abdomen was soft, with no tenderness or pressure \npain, and there was no edema in either lower extremity. \nRebound tenderness was absent, bowel sounds were nor mal, and there was no swelling in the lower limbs. The \npatient was diagnosed with a pulmonary infection upon \nadmission. Owing to the nonspecific nature of her symp toms, it is necessary to rule out other possibilities such as \natypical pathogens, viral infections, and fungal infections \nwhen determining the causative agents of the pulmonary \ninfection.\nFig. 1 Chest computed tomography scan of the patient.

On the third day of hospitalization, bron choscopy was performed, revealing a normal bronchial \ntree (Fig.  2). Subsequently, bronchoalveolar lavage was \nconducted, and the BAL fluid (BALF) was sent for testing \nusing metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) \nat the Department of Laboratory, The First Affiliated \nHospital of Nanchang University. On the fourth day of \nhospitalization, mNGS detected 41 sequence reads of \nTropheryma whipplei. Additionally, no pathogens were \nfound in the previously collected sputum and blood cul tures. On the eighth day of hospitalization, the micro biological culture of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid \nshowed no pathogen growth. On the basis of her clinical \nsymptoms, lung CT findings, negative microbiological \ncultures, and mNGS results, she was diagnosed with a \npulmonary infection caused by Tropheryma whipplei.\nUpon admission, the patient was treated with a com bination therapy consisting of biapenem (0.6  g, intrave nous, every 12 h) and doxycycline hydrochloride tablets \n(100 mg, oral, every 12 h), supplemented with supportive \nmeasures such as nutritional supplementation and main tenance of electrolyte balance. As a result, her tempera ture stabilized, and both her mental and physical strength \nsignificantly improved, with a substantial reduction in \nFig. 2 Fiberoptic bronchoscopy of the patient: trachea carina (A), superior lobe of right lung (B), middle segmental bronchus of right lung (C), \nmiddle lobe of right lung (D), lower lobe of right lung (E), inherent superior lobe of left lung (F), and lingual lobe of left lung (G)\nPage 4 of 6 Shi et al.

On the eighth day of hospitalization, labora tory evaluations revealed a CRP level of 14.65 mg/L, an \nESR of 39 mm/h, a PCT of < 0.1 ng/mL, and an IL-6 level \nof 6.66  pg/mL. Liver and thyroid functions remained \nwithin normal limits, while chest CT scans demonstrated \nabsorption of the infected lung lesions and a reduction in \npleural effusion compared with previous scans (Fig.  1B). \nGiven the slow resolution of lung inflammatory lesions, \nwe conducted a thorough literature review on Troph eryma whipplei infections, considered alternative treat ment options, and initiated hydroxychloroquine sulfate \ntablets (200 mg, oral, three times daily) on the 13th day. \nA follow-up chest CT on the 15th day showed further \nreduction in inflammatory lung lesions (Fig.  1C). Her \ntemperature remained normal, coughing ceased, and \nher overall condition improved, leading to her discharge \non the 16th day. Post discharge, she continued treat ment with doxycycline hydrochloride tablets (100  mg, \noral, every 12 h) and hydroxychloroquine sulfate tablets \n(200  mg, oral, three times daily) but discontinued selfadministered treatment 4  days later. Her temperature \nremained normal without respiratory symptoms such as \ncoughing or sputum production. The patient visited our \noutpatient clinic in late November 2021. A follow-up chest CT showed further reduction in pulmonary inflam matory lesions compared with 29 September 2021. In \nSeptember 2022, during a telephone follow-up regarding \nher condition, the patient reported no discomfort and \nagreed to share her case publicly.\nWe utilized the PubMed database to conduct a com prehensive literature review, focusing exclusively on \nEnglish-language papers. The search encompassed a \ntimeframe stretching from the inception of the database \nuntil 28 November 2022, utilizing the search formula \n“[(Tropheryma Whipplei) OR (Whipple’s disease)] AND \n[(pneumonia) OR (Pulmonary infection)]” . Following the \nretrieval of articles, we meticulously reviewed the titles, \nabstracts, and full texts to exclude studies that were \ndeemed irrelevant, retaining only those that unequivo cally indicated pulmonary infection with Tropheryma \nwhipplei for further scrutiny. Ultimately, eight studies \nmet our criteria and were selected for analysis (Table  1). \nAs depicted in Table  1, these eight studies encompass a \ncumulative total of nine case reports involving pulmo nary infections caused by Tropheryma whipplei. Among \nthese nine patients, six were male and three were female, \nwith ages spanning from 23 to 81  years.

Diagnosis was established \nthrough polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next-gen eration sequencing (NGS) tests on bronchoalveolar lav age fluid or via histological biopsy. Post diagnosis, the \nmajority of patients underwent a switch to sensitive anti biotics, such as tetracycline, doxycycline, hydroxychlo roquine, and sulfamethoxazole, resulting in immediate \nsymptom improvement. Upon monitoring their subse quent condition changes from the time of diagnosis, we \nobserved that eight patients had a favorable prognosis, \nwhereas only one had an unfavorable outcome. Upon \nreviewing the medical history of this latter patient, it \nwas noted that he was of advanced age, had a prior his tory of coronary stenting and hypertension, was in a \npoor baseline condition, and NGS analysis of bronchoal veolar lavage fluid indicated a mixed infection involving \nTropheryma whipplei and Candida sp. However, when \nhis condition deteriorated, he declined extracorporeal \nmembrane oxygenation, ultimately leading to his demise \ndespite aggressive treatment efforts.",
    "Discussion": "Discussion\nWhipple’s disease is a multisystemic disorder, yet pulmo nary involvement remains underreported. The cardinal \nclinical manifestations of lung involvement encompass \ncough, dyspnea, and chest pain, with CT scans revealing \npulmonary nodules, interstitial alterations, and patchy \ninfiltrates [16]. Owing to the absence of specific diag nostic markers, Whipple’s disease frequently goes unrec ognized or misdiagnosed, often resulting in a delayed \ndiagnosis. Prior to the advent of polymerase chain reac tion (PCR) as a diagnostic tool, approximately 12 cases \nof classical Whipple’s disease were identified annually \nworldwide based on duodenal biopsy studies, although \nthe actual incidence is likely much higher [17]. The cur rent estimated global annual incidence ranges from 1 to \n6 new cases per 10 million individuals [17]. Diagnosis of \nWhipple’s disease is challenging, with a median delay of \nover 6 years between the onset of initial symptoms and \ndefinitive diagnosis [18]. Currently, tissue biopsy, particu larly with Periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining or immu nohistochemical analysis of biopsy specimens, is widely \nregarded as the gold standard for diagnosing classical \nWhipple’s disease. In contrast, PCR testing of bodily flu ids serves as the primary basis for diagnosing limited \nchronic infections. Microbiological cultures and serologi cal tests are not routinely employed owing to their lack \nof specificity in blood tests [18]. In addition, in recent \nyears, with advancements in microbial genetic testing \ntechnology, mNGS has played a significant role in diag nosing Whipple’s disease infections. mNGS is a novel \npathogen detection technology that offers high efficiency, a broad spectrum of pathogens, and high sensitivity. It is \nparticularly suitable for detecting rare pathogens. Com pared with traditional",
    "Methods": "methods, mNGS has demon strated superior diagnostic performance [19]. However, \nmNGS also has notable shortcomings, such as its diffi culty in distinguishing between pathogens and coloniz ing microorganisms. Additionally, the mNGS workflow \nis complex and involves multiple processes, which poses \nchallenges to its widespread use. Apart from technical \nchallenges, other factors limiting the broad implementa tion of mNGS include inadequate quality assurance, high \ncosts, and considerations regarding sequencing depth \n[20]. Tropheryma whipplei infection can lead to clas sic Whipple’s disease, chronic localized infections, acute \ninfections, and asymptomatic infections. The clinical \nsymptoms of this disease are nonspecific, making it dif ficult for clinicians to detect. When patients present with \nfrequent episodes of arthralgia, arthritis of large joints, \nseronegative polyarthritis, chronic diarrhea, malabsorp tion syndrome, abdominal pain, and unexplained weight \nloss, Whipple’s disease should be considered, prompting \ntargeted investigations [21]. In terms of treatment, doxy cycline combined with hydroxychloroquine constitutes \nan effective bactericidal regimen against Tropheryma \nwhipplei, typically involving a 1-year course of doxycy cline and hydroxychloroquine followed by lifelong doxy cycline maintenance therapy. However, Whipple’s disease \nis characterized by a high recurrence rate, with 30–40% \nof patients experiencing relapses, necessitating regular \nmonitoring. In the absence of clinical symptoms, bian nual PCR monitoring of stool, saliva, and urine suffices \n[18, 22]. In reviewing the case we managed, we estab lished a diagnosis of Tropheryma whipplei pneumonia \nbased on the patient’s symptoms (fever with dry cough), \nimaging findings suggestive of pulmonary infection, \nnegative microbiological culture results, and pathogenic \ngenetic testing from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. During \nthe treatment process, we empirically initiated a regimen \nof doxycycline combined with biapenem upon admission, \nwhich led to rapid alleviation of the patient’s fatigue and \ndry cough, along with temperature control. This is con sistent with the majority of reported diagnoses and treat ment courses for Whipple’s disease.However, despite a \n10-day course of antiinfective therapy, the patient’s lung \nCT showed minimal improvement in inflammation. At \ndischarge, we adjusted the treatment plan to include dox ycycline hydrochloride (100  mg, orally, every 12  h) and \nhydroxychloroquine sulfate (200  mg, orally, three  times \ndaily). Unfortunately, the patient did not adhere to the \ntreatment regimen and discontinued her medication on \nher own 4 days post discharge. Despite the short duration \nof treatment, 1 year later, the patient reported no respira tory symptoms such as fever or cough, which contrasts \nPage 6 of 6 Shi et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:613 \nwith previous studies suggesting a treatment duration of \nover 1 year. Classic Whipple’s disease is a rare systemic \ncondition typically characterized by weight loss, diar rhea, and arthralgia. Reports of acute pulmonary infec tions caused by Tropheryma whipplei are even rarer, and \nthere are no large-scale clinical studies confirming the \nduration of therapy for Whipple’s pneumonia. Notably, \nthe patient we managed did not exhibit symptoms of \nweight loss, diarrhea, or arthralgia; thus, we considered \nher condition to be an acute pulmonary infection caused \nby Tropheryma whipplei. Although she discontinued her \nmedication 4 days after discharge, the absence of symp tom recurrence suggests that the treatment duration \nfor acute pulmonary infections caused by Tropheryma \nwhipplei may not be as prolonged as previously thought. \nFurther research with larger sample sizes is needed to \nvalidate the treatment duration for acute infections \ncaused by Tropheryma whipplei.\nConclusion\nWe report a rare case of pneumonia caused by Troph eryma whipplei. Whipple’s disease is a systemic infec tious disease caused by Tropheryma whipplei that may \naffect multiple systems throughout the body. Whipple’s \ndisease has a very low incidence and is difficult to diag nose. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing has good \nvalue in detecting Tropheryma whipplei infection.\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.\nAuthor contributions\nJ.S. reviewed the literature and wrote the initial drafts of the manuscript; R.L., \nJ.Q., C.W., D.P ., T.X., and N.C. managed the patient, reviewed the literature, \nand contributed to the completion of the manuscript.
