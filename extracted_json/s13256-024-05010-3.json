    "Background": "Background Crohn’s disease and irritable bowel syndrome may both cause abdominal pain and diarrhea. Irritable \nbowel syndrome not only is an important differential diagnosis for Crohn’s disease but also occurs in one out of three \npatients with Crohn’s disease in remission in parallel. If not adequately diagnosed and treated, additional functional \nsymptoms such as fatigue and/or muscle pain may develop, indicating a more severe course.",
    "Case Presentation": "Case presentation A 64-year-old Caucasian male with long-standing, widely inactive Crohn’s disease presented \nwith persistent diarrhea, bloating, abdominal pain, general fatigue, unexplained hip pain, and frequent shivering \nwith cold extremities, which had worsened following a gastrointestinal infection and psychological stress. A plausible \nexplanation of his symptoms, based on an understanding of mind–body interactions, the autonomic nervous system, \nand temperature regulation, combined with symptom relief, was associated with rapid and sustainable improvement. \nAfter 2.5 years of follow-up, the patient is almost symptom-free.\nConclusions This case report exemplifies the interrelation between organic (Crohn’s disease) and functional diseases \n(irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and somatoform pain). It further demonstrates that these connections may be overlooked in daily practice and that providing a plausible explanation in combination with symp tom relief may be important for patients with functional syndromes.\nKeywords  Autonomic nervous system, Gut-brain axis, Complementary medicine, Opium, Somatoform pain\nBackground\nInflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) include the subtypes \nCrohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) and are \ncharacterized by an overactive immune system destruc tive to the gastrointestinal tract [1–3]. Patients with CD \npresent with various, often unspecific abdominal symp toms, in particular diarrhea, bloating, cramps, abdominal pain, and fatigue. In more severe cases, bloody stools, \nweight loss, fever, anemia, stenosis, or fistulae may be \npresent [4, 5]. Owing to overlapping symptoms, irritable \nbowel syndrome (IBS) is an important differential diag nosis for CD. IBS is considered a common functional \ndisorder of gut–brain interaction, with symptoms mainly \ntriggered by diet, stress, medications, and gastrointestinal \ninfections [6–11]. It is now established that not only IBS \nbut also IBD is associated with dysregulated gut–brain \nand microbiota–gut–brain axes, providing the physi ological link between the central nervous system (CNS) \nand the gastrointestinal tract [12–16]. Accurate diagno sis, primarily through ileocolonoscopy and blood tests, *Correspondence:\nRoman Huber\nroman.huber@uniklinik-freiburg.de\n1 Center for Complementary Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine \nII, Faculty of Medicine, Medical Center – University of Freiburg, University \nof Freiburg, 79106 Freiburg, Germany\nPage 2 of 18 Haedrich and Huber  Journal of Medical Case Reports            (2025) 19:9 \nis essential to distinguish between these two conditions \nand other possible disorders, ensuring appropriate man agement. The treatment of CD aims to control the body’s \ninflammatory response with the help of immunomodu lators and corticosteroids. Surgical intervention may be \nrequired in case of stenosis or fistulae.\nOver the past two decades, a growing body of evidence \nhas shown that patients with CD in remission may expe rience symptoms of IBS [17–25], sometimes making \ndifferentiation challenging, as concomitant IBS symp toms can mimic active IBD. Accurate diagnosis through \npatient-centered dialog is crucial for appropriate medi cal and behavioral management [18, 26–30]. Studies \nhave shown that the frequency of IBS in CD patients in \nlong-term remission can be as high as 35%, which is three \ntimes higher than the global prevalence of IBS symptoms \nin the general population (11%) [8, 17–25], with a con siderable impact on their quality of life [19, 20]. With this \ncase report, we aim to highlight this concurrence of CD \nwith IBD and provide an example of initial neglect and \nultimately successful treatment.\nCase presentation\nCurrent medical history\nA 64-year-old Caucasian male presented in February \n2022 with persistent diarrhea, bloating accompanied by \nabdominal pain, frequent headaches, shivering, and cold \nextremities lasting for 2–3 weeks each month, insomnia, \nand general fatigue. He had a history of Crohn’s disease \n(CD) with an ileocecal resection involving 42 cm of the \nterminal ileum and 10 cm of the cecum immediately fol lowing his initial diagnosis in early 1981, Montreal Clas sification A2, L3, B3 [31]. Biopsies from the terminal \nileum and ascending colon revealed transmural inflam mation and epithelioid granulomas. Since surgery, CD \nhad widely remained in remission, with occasional epi sodes of low-grade nonspecific ileitis (1984, 1991, 2006) \nand low-grade chronic colitis (1986) seen on ileocolo noscopy (Table  1). Inappropriate to CD in remission, the \npatient suffered from chronic diarrhea, up to four times \na day and often imperative, which numerous medical \nspecialists that he consulted considered to be unusual. \nAnnual ESR, CRP , and blood count",
    "Results": "results were normal. \nThe patient was taking cholestyramine 6 g per day, lop eramide hydrochloride 2 mg per day, probiotic bacterial \ncultures (1.1 ×  1010  CFU per capsule) two capsules once \ndaily (self-medication), cyanocobalamin 1000  µg IM \nevery 6 months, and ramipril 5 mg once daily. He had no \nhistory of smoking or alcohol consumption and reported \na paternal family history of asthma and neurodermatitis. \nThere was no family history of inflammatory bowel dis ease (IBD) or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).Expanded medical history\nFrom early childhood, he was exposed to stressful life \nevents, including being placed in an infant home from \nage 0 to 6 months, experiencing physical and emotional \nabuse in a children’s sanatorium at age 9, and frequent \nchanges of caregivers (various nurses, grandparents, an \naunt, parents, and a nanny). Until the age of 3, he fre quently refused to eat and later suffered from asthma, \nfood-related skin rashes, and frequent infections, which \nwere treated with antibiotics and resulted in frequent \nabsences from school. At age 9, he underwent tonsillec tomy and was sent to a sanatorium 900 km away.\nWhen the patient was 21 (1979), during his first year \nof studies at university, an elevated ESR was incidentally \ndiscovered. Persistent diarrhea began during his pregraduate examinations in 1980, accompanied by weight \nloss (from 78 to 62 kg within 4 months) and abdominal \npain after food intake (Table  1). In early 1981, the patient \ncanceled his current year of studying abroad owing to \npersistent diarrhea, increased and persistent pain in the \nright lower abdomen, continuous weight loss, and gen eral fatigue. When fever occurred, exploratory open \nabdominal surgery was performed in February 1981 to \ndrain a right-sided iliopsoas abscess. Two weeks later, a \nconglomerate of caked intestinal loops was removed dur ing an open ileocecal resection (ICR). The patient was \ndischarged on a light vegetarian diet and sulfasalazine \n2  g once daily, with a weight of 60  kg. The main symp tom remained diarrhea, with up to six episodes out of up \nto eight bowel movements (BM) per day. Cholestyramine \ninstantly reduced the frequency of diarrhea to 0–2 per \nday (1–3 BM/day). From 1985 (age 27), the patient’s con dition stabilized. He spent 2 months in the Philippines for \nextensive martial arts training, enjoying very good health \nwith no CD-related symptoms. The patient followed a \nvegetarian diet but avoided milk, eggs, hard cheese, who legrain products, raw vegetables, citrus fruits, and fruit \njuices to prevent bowel problems. In 1995, he underwent \nlaparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholecystolithiasis, a \ncommon complication in CD patients (Table 1).\nDuring years of being bullied by a superior (2008–\n2017) while holding an attractive position at a Euro pean Union research institution since 2006, the patient’s \nblood pressure increased from 130/85  mmHg in 2008 \nto 160/95  mmHg in 2017, and his weight rose from 74 \nto 82 kg. Additional symptoms manifested in 2017, pri marily painful diarrhea two to three times daily, frequent \nflu-like symptoms, fatigue, urinary urgency, and cold \nextremities (Table  1). Flu-like symptoms and shiver ing mainly occurred after fitness exercise, long-distance \nflights, or exposure to cold air. They occurred without \nfever, did not involve the upper respiratory tract, and \nlasted for 2–3 weeks approximately six times a year. \nPage 3 of 18\n Haedrich and Huber  Journal of Medical Case Reports            (2025) 19:9 \n Table 1 Timeline: patient’s symptoms, diagnoses, treatment, and significant events, based on available medical reports and patient’s self-disclosure\nDate Age (years) Symptoms Diagnoses Treatment Significant events, remarks\n10/1957–04/1958 0–1/2 Diarrhea at age 4–12 weeks Unknown 11/1957: Breast feeding ends at age \n6 weeks (diarrhea)After birth, patient is transferred \nto a baby nursing home for 6 months; \nreportedly crying most of the time, refusing food\n1958–1966 1–9 frequent colds, otitis media, coughing; \neczema from red currants and rhubarbAsthma, dermatitis Antibiotics\n02/1966: Tonsillectomy; 04/1966: \n6 weeks at a North Sea sanatorium04/1966: Patient admitted to children’s \nsanatorium on the North Sea for 6 weeks \n(“deported child”) where he like many \nother children suffers psychological \nand physical violence\n10–12/1980 23 Diarrhea 4–6/day; intermittent, then \nabdominal pain\nWeight loss 16 kg within 4 months \n(now 62 kg, 176 cm)Duodenal ulcer (suspected) 19 Dec 1980: Cimetidine 200 mg PO \nqidPre-graduate exams (chemistry); persistent diarrhea, abdominal pain after food \nintake; symptoms alleviate during physical exercise.

He no longer felt sociable and avoided making \nappointments. He consulted gastroenterologists, intern ists, and psychosomatic specialists, who explained, that \nthe frequent “colds” were most likely due to a weakened \nimmune system caused by stress. Following a severe \ngastrointestinal infection of unknown origin in 2019, \nepisodes of diarrhea, bloating with abdominal pain, \nand flu-like symptoms intensified. These episodes now \noccurred on a monthly basis especially after exposure to \ncool air or moderate physical exercise, each lasting 2–3 \nweeks. They were accompanied by general fatigue, head ache, brain fog, dizziness, poor memory, exceptional \ntiredness, and abdominal pain, which was most pro nounced before BMs. Additionally, bloating, sometimes \naccompanied by diarrhea, tiredness, and drowsiness, \nwould occur within an hour of commencing physical \nexercise or intense intellectual work, forcing the patient \nto suspend these activities. Conversely, a short walk or \nlight exercise alleviated headache, fatigue, and tiredness. \nInsomnia and the inability to wind down resulted in non restorative sleep and daytime tiredness.\nThe patient also reported episodic unilateral hip pain \nstarting in 2020, which became bilateral by 2022, some times so severe that he was unable to walk more than \n100–200 m. However, MRI and X-ray scans only revealed \nlow-grade osteoarthritis, which did not explain the severe \nintermittent pain. The patient’s self-trials with probiotic \nbacteria, aimed at alleviating a suspected leaky gut syn drome, proved unsuccessful. Colonoscopy and histology \nresults in August 2019 showed no inflammation in the \nneoterminal ileum and colon, suggesting that CD was in \nremission. This was supported by normal ESR, CRP , and \ncomplete blood count results.\nPhysical examination and psychological evaluation\nThe patient presented in good general condition with a \nnormal body mass index (BMI) of 27 (height 1.76  m, \nweight 85 kg). He had two surgical scars on his abdomen. \nBowel sounds were hyperactive, indicating increased per istalsis, and palpation of the abdomen was normal with out tenderness. Examination of the chest, joints, spine, \nmuscles, thyroid, and neurological status revealed no rel evant pathological findings. His pulse rate was regular at \n58 bpm, and his blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg. The \npatient was clear in his thoughts, emotionally responsive, \nand exhibited a normal drive with a tendency toward \nperfectionism.\nDiagnostic interpretation\nOur patient presented with a Crohn’s Disease Activity \nIndex (CDAI) score [32] of 183 points (based on weight 85  kg, hematocrit 45%), slightly above the threshold of \n150 points, indicating only mild and not necessarily CDspecific activity. The elevated CDAI score was attribut able to persistent diarrhea and abdominal pain associated \nwith bloating. Nonspecific, low-grade colitis and ileitis \nhad been detected twice between 1984 and 2006 during \nregular ileocolonoscopies and histopathological examina tion of biopsies but did not explain the bowel symptoms \nthat worsened after exposure to cold air, physical exer tion, or certain dietary products. Chologenic diarrhea \nwas likely present in the years following ileocecal resec tion, though not diagnosed specifically, as the patient \npromptly responded to cholestyramine. Therefore, alter native causes other than CD were considered to explain \nthe patient’s ongoing diarrhea over the past four decades \nand the additional symptoms experienced since 2017 \n(Table  2). Food allergies, fructose or lactose intolerance, \nsmall intestine bacterial overgrowth, and gluten intoler ance were addressed and excluded through detailed his tory taking or blood tests (negative transglutaminase \nantibodies). We considered the intermittent pain related \nto defecation as atypical for CD and more typical for irri table bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) [17].\nHallmarks of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel \nsyndrome (IBS-D), a type of IBS likely present in our \npatient, include otherwise unexplained persistent diar rhea, bloating, and abdominal pain occurring at least \nonce a week, according to the Rome IV diagnostic criteria \n[8, 33]. Factors involved in this disorder of the gut–brain \naxis include increased intestinal permeability, intestinal \nsensitivity, increased gut motility, changes in gut micro biota composition, visceral hypersensitivity, stress, and \nanxiety [6, 10, 15].\nThe natural course of symptoms and risk factors con tributing to IBS can begin as early as infancy [8] (Table  1). \nEarly adverse life events, such as those experienced by \nour patient, can trigger the development of somatic \ncomplaints later in life. Risk factors associated with IBS \ninclude loss and separation during childhood [34, 35], \nparental deprivation [35], or rejection [36], emotional \n[37, 38] and physical abuse [36–39], punishment [36, 37], \nconflicted or dependent maternal relationships [34], sup pressed feelings of anger and resentment [37], and child hood anxiety [36]. Conversely, studies have shown that \nparental emotional warmth can be protective against IBS \n[36]. Frequent infections and antibiotic use in infancy are \nassociated with an increased risk of IBD, while breast feeding has been shown to be protective against IBD [40].\nIn adults, stress-induced alterations in neuroendo crine–immune pathways affect the microbiota–gut–\nbrain (MGB) axis, modulated by the vagus nerve, which \ncan lead to a flare-up of IBS symptoms [6, 7, 10, 15, 41]. \nStressful life events are known to potentially exacerbate \nPage 10 of 18 Haedrich and Huber  Journal of Medical Case Reports            (2025) 19:9 \nTable 2 Course of patient’s symptoms, based on available medical reports and patient’s self-disclosure.

Therefore, \nboth IBD and IBS treatment should include the manage ment of stress and stress-related responses [16]. Given \nour patient’s personal and medical history, and that the \nsymptoms experienced while CD had largely been in \nremission and without stenosis, we assume that adverse \nearly life events and chronic stress throughout childhood, \nadolescence, and professional life likely contributed to \nthe development and eventual exacerbation of IBS-D \nflares.\nIncreased urinary frequency and urinary urgency, \nincluding nocturnal urination, as noted in our patient, \nhave been shown to be associated with IBS and primar ily IBS-D, suggesting shared pathophysiology and visceral \ninteractions between the two closely located organs via \ncommon sensory pathways [44]. Dysfunction in the auto nomic nervous system, that is, an imbalance between the \nsympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, can \nlead to an overactive bladder [45]. Urinary tract infection, \nneurological causes, and benign prostate hyperplasia \nwere excluded. Every 2–3 weeks, after physical exertion \nor exposure to low temperatures, our patient experienced \nflu-like symptoms and shivering accompanied by diar rhea and cold extremities (Tables  1, 2). Cold extremities \ncan also be related to increased sympathetic nerve activ ity, as it plays a key role in both circadian temperature \nregulation and stress response, resulting in peripheral \nvasoconstriction and consequently reduced heat loss and \nan increase in the body’s core temperature [46–48].\nFollowing a severe gastrointestinal infection in 2019, \nthe patient experienced additional symptoms includ ing headache, brain fog, dizziness, failing memory, and \nexceptional fatigue after only light physical activities. \nThese symptoms are reminiscent of a condition termed \npost-exertional malaise (PEM), a characteristic feature of \nchronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Indeed, CFS has been \nshown to occur more frequently in patients with IBS fol lowing intestinal infections [49–53]. Strong mental or \nphysical exertion, or time pressure, exacerbated these \nneurological and cognitive deficits and caused bloating \nwith abdominal pain within about an hour. Conversely, \nsome relief was observed after prolonged periods of \nrelaxation, often overnight [41, 42]. We assumed that the \npatient approached these activities with high tension and \nself-expectations, which could have triggered the men tioned vegetative symptoms. Arthralgia/myalgia mani fested in the patient in 2020 and can be interpreted as \na further somatoform symptom, belonging to the CFS–\nfibromyalgia complex. The pain-related functional limi tations significantly impaired his ability to participate in \ndaily life. Nonrestorative sleep, tinnitus, urinary urgency, and impaired thermoregulation complete a pattern \nstrongly suggestive of autonomic nervous system dys regulation associated with existing IBS-D (Table  2). Our \npatient observed symptom flare-ups when swimming in \ncold water or being exposed to cold air. While experi encing almost continuous flare-ups in winter, symptoms \nwere less intense and occurred less frequently in sum mer. We interpreted this pattern as consistent with our \nhypothesis. Cool ambient temperatures would activate \nthe sympathetic tone and trigger bodily stress reactions \nmediated by the autonomous nervous system in this \nsensitive individual [54]. A prevalence of thermal hyper sensitivity, an altered sensation in response to thermal \nstimuli, along with elevated cortisol levels, has also been \nfound in IBS-D patients [55, 56]. In another study, IBS \npatients showed significant symptoms after cold water \nintake [57]. The severity of IBS symptoms and both vis ceral and thermal hypersensitivity have been shown to be \npositively correlated [56].\nThe severe intestinal infection in 2019 exacerbated the \npatient’s IBS-D symptoms and triggered new debilitat ing symptoms (neurological, cognitive), as mentioned \nabove. This deterioration can also be understood within \nthe context of our hypothesis if the intestinal infection \nis regarded as a threatening, stressful event (Tables  1, 2). \nStudies have shown that up to 35% of IBS-D patients [58] \nexperience a sudden onset or worsening of IBS symptoms \nfollowing bacterial or viral gastroenteritis, which is one \nof the strongest risk factors for IBS [8, 52, 58–60]. We \nassume that the infectious gastroenteritis affected the \ngut–brain axis and increased IBS flare-ups in our patient, \nclassifying this as post-infectious irritable bowel syn drome (PI-IBS) [10, 11, 16, 58, 60–65].\nIn summary, the variety, intensity, and persistence of \nour patient’s complaints, including numerous nongastro intestinal symptoms and syndromes, were beyond what \nwould be expected in widely inactive Crohn’s disease. \nOn the basis of his medical and personal history since \ninfancy, physical examination, pattern of symptoms, nor mal laboratory results, absence of any alarm features [8], \nand a detailed",
    "Discussion": "discussion with the informed patient about \nthe course and severity of his symptoms and experiences, \nwe attributed his symptoms to autonomic nervous sys tem dysregulation with disturbance of the gut–brain axis \n(IBS-D) and CFS.\nTherapeutic approach\nAccording to our hypothesis, the interventions were pri marily designed to stabilize the autonomic nervous sys tem of the patient. They included establishing a trusting \nrelationship between patient and healthcare provider \nand, on this basis, explaining to the patient the probable \ncauses of his condition and the origins of his experienced \nPage 12 of 18 Haedrich and Huber  Journal of Medical Case Reports            (2025) 19:9 \nsymptoms in detail. Effective symptom management \nshould demonstrate to him that the hypotheses are \ncorrect.\nFor symptom control, loperamide was substituted with \na tincture of opium (an oral solution of anhydrous mor phine 10  mg/mL extracted from Papaver somniferum \nL., succus siccus,  Dropizol®), which, in our experience, \nis more effective in reducing intestinal motility. Owing \nto this advantage, opium tincture has been receiving \nincreasing attention in recent literature for the treatment \nof chronic functional diarrhea [66–69]. The extract con tains minor amounts of codeine (methyl morphine) and \nthebaine (dimethyl morphine), as well as the isoquino line-derived alkaloids papaverine and noscapine [66, 70].\nAfter oral morphine administration, rapid intesti nal absorption occurs, with peak plasma levels reached \nwithin 30–90  minutes and an average elimination halflife of 1.4–3.4  hours [69]. Morphine is predominantly \nbiotransformed in the liver to two main metabolites: \nmorphine-3-glucuronide (M3G), a µ-opioid receptor \nantagonist, and the µ-opioid receptor-active morphine6-glucuronide (M6G), resulting in a relatively low aver age morphine bioavailability of 35% [69, 71, 72]. The area \nunder the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC) for \nM6G has been reported to be 10 times larger than that \nof morphine [73], suggesting that M6G significantly \ncontributes to morphine’s antidiarrheal effect [69]. In \ncomparison, the plasma half-life of orally administered \nloperamide (9–14  hours) tends to be higher than that \nof the active morphine metabolite M6G (9–10  hours); \nhowever, its bioavailability may be two orders of mag nitude lower, at 0.3% compared with 35% for morphine \n[69]. Both the higher bioavailability of morphine after \noral administration and the accumulation of high M6G \nplasma levels may explain the efficacy of opium tinc ture over loperamide in the treatment of chronic diar rhea. An additional antidiarrheal effect may be attributed \nto codeine [69], which is present in minor quantities in \nopium tincture. Although codeine appears to be six to \nseven times less potent at the µ-opioid receptor than \nmorphine [74], its potency is still higher than that of \nthe synthetic opiates loperamide and diphenoxylate \n[66]. Approximately 10% of orally ingested codeine is \nconverted to morphine, primarily in the liver [74], and \nsubsequently to M3G and the µ-opioid receptor-active \nmetabolite M6G.\nThe manufacturer’s recommended dose of mor phine equivalents for adults with chronic diarrhea is \n2.5–5.0 mg two to three times a day; however, the dos age should be customized and fine-tuned to optimize \nresults. Morphine equivalent doses of 1.0–10  mg four \ntimes a day [66], 1.5–10 mg four times a day [67], and up to 10 mg in a single dose with a maximum total daily \ndose of 60  mg [69] have been suggested. Our patient \nstarted with three drops of opium tincture twice a \nday (a total daily dose of 3  mg morphine) and gradu ally increased the dosage until the desired antidiarrheal \neffect was achieved. The patient was also advised to \ntake one capsule containing 80 mg of Lavandula aspic  \nL. essential oil twice a day (brand name  Lasea®), which \nis known for its relaxing and soothing effects. It has \nproven efficacious in several randomized controlled tri als for treating sleep problems and anxiety [75– 77]. The \npatient continued taking 6 g of cholestyramine per day. \nRamipril 5 mg once a day was eventually replaced with \na combination of 16 mg candesartan cilexetil and 5 mg \namlodipine. With a 42-cm ileal resection, our patient \nwas at risk of vitamin B12 malabsorption, which is why \nwe advised him to continue taking methyl cobalamin \n500 µg orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) twice a week.\nBefore presenting to our outpatient clinic, our patient \nhad tried various probiotic preparations containing \nLactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp., but these \ndid not have the desired positive effect on his intestinal \ncomplaints.\nSince 1981, the patient has followed a trial and errorbased vegetarian diet, which was later maintained for \nethical reasons as well. Dietary restrictions based on \nsubjective intolerances included, among others, meat, \nfish, poultry, cow’s milk, lactose-free milk, ice cream, \ncornflakes, eggs, hard cheeses, deep-fried foods, hot \nspices (such as pepper and chili), raw vegetables, toma toes, apples, citrus fruits, pineapple, rhubarb, acidic \nfruit juices, and soft drinks, as they presumably caused \nbowel problems.\nWe suggested a general reduction of stress to stabi lize the disturbed autonomic nervous system and gut–\nbrain axis. Suggestions included maintaining regular \nmeal and sleep timing, such as taking dinner early and \nin moderate quantities to improve the quality and dura tion of sleep, and avoiding eating immediately before \nphysical exercise. Regarding diet, we recommended a \n“back to normal” approach. Only raw food, cruciferous \nvegetables, and wholegrain bread should be avoided, as \nthey may cause bloating and increase stool frequency. \nWe considered regular physical activity to be a key \nelement in managing IBS. However, since our patient \ntended to exercise with high tension and self-expecta tion, which triggered vegetative symptoms, we advised \nhim to perform only moderate physical exercise and to \nmonitor his heart rate, keeping it ≤ 130  bpm. The aim \nof this energy management, known as pacing, is to \navoid overloading and excessive stress in everyday life \nby adhering to the individual stress limits set by the \ncondition. Furthermore, we suggested that he learns \nPage 13 of 18\n Haedrich and Huber  Journal of Medical Case Reports            (2025) 19:9 \n \nrelaxation techniques such as yoga or autogenic train ing and integrates them into his daily lifestyle.\nFurther course of symptoms and patient´s perspective\nOur patient reported an immediate and dramatic \nimprovement in both the frequency and severity of diar rhea after increasing the daily dose of opium tincture \nfrom three to six drops twice a day (a total daily dose \nof 6  mg morphine) while simultaneously discontinuing \nloperamide. The number of BMs decreased from four \nto six each day to an average of two per day, and in the \ntwo following years, only one or two episodes of diar rhea occurred on 2–3  days per month (Tables  1, 2). \nAlong with the reduction in diarrhea, the intermittent \nabdominal pain notably improved. General fatigue, along \nwith flu-like symptoms, headache, and brain fog, which \nhad persisted for 2–3  weeks every month before our \ninterventions, was soon reduced to 1 week in a 3-month \nperiod and was less severe. The associated insomnia was \nreduced to about 1 week each month, while hip joint \npain, urinary urgency, cold extremities, disturbed tem perature regulation, and tinnitus remained unchanged \ninitially. Our patient reported the almost immediate rees tablishment of social contacts and, after a few months, \nthe ability to undertake long-distance travel and exten sive but heart rate-controlled cycling tours, both of which \nhad previously been impossible for several years. After \n2–3  hours on flat terrain (road bike) or about 1  hour \non inclines (mountain bike), slight bloating sometimes \noccurred, which subsided after 1–2 hours, but there was \nno increase in BMs or diarrhea.\nOur patient’s condition improved even further from \nearly 2024 (2 years after the beginning of our multimodal \ntreatment) and has stabilized at a good level since then \n(reported 2.5 years after the start of treatment) over the \nfollowing 6 months (Tables  1, 2). He attributed the fur ther improvement to the intake of glutamine (10 g twice a \nday). In patients with IBS-D, increased intestinal perme ability might be due to decreased glutamine synthetase \nlevels [78]. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-con trolled, multicenter study including patients with PI-IBS \nand intestinal hyperpermeability, L-glutamine (5 g three \ntimes a day) led to a significant reduction in all important \nIBS-related endpoints [79]. While flu-like symptoms con tinued to be felt for about 1 week every 6 months, general \nfatigue subsided along with abdominal pain, brain fog, \ndizziness, poor memory, and extreme tiredness. Bloat ing, headache, temperature dysregulation, tinnitus, and \ninsomnia had clearly lessened. Diarrhea and bloating \noccasionally occurred after acute stress or physical exer tion, but to a much lesser extent. Arthralgia had almost \ncompletely disappeared after a total period of 3  years, \neven without drug therapy with anti-inflammatory painkillers. Low ambient temperatures and physical \nexertion no longer necessarily led to the development \nof flu-like symptoms with the described accompanying \ncomplaints. The CDAI score [32] was 87 points in June \n2024 (weight 81  kg, hematocrit 43.7%), compared with \n183 points at the time of our first intervention.\nFrom the patient’s perspective, there was a life before \nthe diagnosis in February 1981 at the age of 23, and \nanother life afterwards. This sentiment was echoed by the \nsurgical ward physician 6 weeks after ileocecal resection, \nwhen the patient was discharged on elemental feed, with \npersistent diarrhea and 15 kg underweight. The physician \nsaid, “Say goodbye to your previous life. Stop studying, sit \non a deckchair in the garden, and apply for early retire ment. Expect further surgeries every two years as long as \nyou still have intestines. ” At that time, the patient felt that \nCrohn’s disease was something new and rare, and that the \ntreating physicians did not really know how to handle his \ncondition. Medical care seemed more focused on healing \nthe extensive scars extending downwards from below the \ncostal arches: one on the right side from iliopsoas abscess \ndrainage, and the other in the center from the ileocecal \nresection.\nAfter rehabilitation, he decided to rebuild his body by \ntaking up karate. A few years later, he obtained a PhD in \nchemistry and worked in demanding academic positions \nwith 12-hour days. He is grateful that his life turned out \nthe way it did, despite the unfavorable prognosis at the \ntime and the many challenging days and weeks along the \nway.\nYet, over the past four decades, diarrhea has been \nwith him like a faithful companion, although CD was \nrepeatedly diagnosed as being in remission. This raised \nquestions and necessitated meticulous planning and \ncoordination of all work processes, meetings, presenta tions, and other work-related activities, medical appoint ments, recreational activities, social engagements, and \nholidays. The morning hours until 10 a.m. were par ticularly challenging, as urgent bowel movements were \ncommon, even without diarrhea. During this time, how ever, he was required to lead team meetings for ongo ing research programmes. Additionally, throughout the \n1990s, his role as a quality manager at a food testing facil ity with 220 employees demanded constant availability. A \nparticular challenge emerged in 2006 when he assumed \nmanagement of a research unit at a European Reference \nLaboratory. Throughout his career, only his closest labo ratory assistants were privy to his health issues.\nDuring medical consultations following regular colo noscopies at various hospitals, he received no expla nation for his persistent diarrhea. Responses such as \n“that shouldn’t really be happening” or “we still know \ntoo little about this rare condition” were perceived as \nPage 14 of 18 Haedrich and Huber  Journal of Medical Case Reports            (2025) 19:9 \nunsympathetic, inadequate, and disappointing, leaving \nhim with a sense of abandonment. Therefore, he wished \nfor more robust medical intervention but was left to \nmanage alone. He explored virtually every option that \npresented itself, even turning to expensive “healers” twice \nin vain. He thought food utilization was inadequate or \nseveral small portions taken throughout the day as rec ommended did not last. Nevertheless, he had to maintain \npeak mental performance for his demanding research \nleadership role.\nBetween 2012 and 2016, escalating envy-driven bul lying compounded the challenges of his working life. \nAs the symptoms increased in number and worsened in \nearly 2017, the carefully maintained façade began to dis integrate. Peculiarly, he now seemed to contract the flu \nbimonthly, enduring 2–3 weeks of diarrhea, abdominal \npain, and an unprecedented level of fatigue. Resorting to \na restricted diet of oatmeal, potatoes, and select vegeta bles, he attempted to minimize appointments. Had the \nconstant stress further exacerbated the strain on his com promised intestines? Like the proverbial frog in boiling \nwater, had he been oblivious to the gradually worsening \nconditions? After all these years, was he finally confront ing a relapse of Crohn’s disease? As bullying intensified \nand symptoms deteriorated, he was ultimately compelled \nto take sick leave in July 2017.\nHis condition took another massive turn for the worse \nin March 2019 after a severe 3-week bout of infectious \ngastroenteritis. The following 3 years were marked by \nspending two-thirds of his life either in bed or at rest. \nExposure to low temperatures, such as during a walk or \nbike ride, or engaging in physical exercise, would trig ger debilitating episodes lasting 2–3 weeks. These phases \nwere marked by a sense of malaise, cold extremities, diar rhea up to four times a day with bloating and abdominal \npain, profound fatigue, extreme tiredness, and headaches \npreceding bowel movements. Additionally, he experi enced cognitive difficulties, including impaired focus and \nword recall. His daily functional window was reduced to \na mere 1–2 hours in the late morning, during which he \ncould manage housework or nearby shopping, but these \nactivities would leave him exhausted for the remainder of \nthe day. Returning to work was unthinkable, and all social \ncontacts had ceased. Then, in November 2020, severe hip \npain developed, first unilaterally and later bilaterally. By \nSeptember 2021, after weeks of struggling to walk and \ncontemplating hip replacement, a specialist reviewed his \nX-rays and MRI scans, diagnosing mild hip osteoarthri tis consistent with his age but unable to account for the \nseverity of his pain. Further consultations with special ists in gastroenterology, internal medicine, nutrition, and \neven psychosomatics (as he felt stress aggravated many of \nhis symptoms) yielded no conclusive explanation for his symptom pattern. Now in early retirement, barely able to \neat, walk, or sleep properly, and incapable of engaging in \nany activities, he felt hopeless, with no light at the end of \nthe tunnel.\nUtterly disheartened but persistently encouraged by \nhis wife, a physician at the same university hospital, he \nresolved to consult a specialist in internal medicine, gas troenterology, and naturopathy at the Centre for Comple mentary Medicine at the University of Freiburg’s Faculty \nof Medicine in February 2022, as a last resort. Remarkably, \nthe half-hour consultation was phenomenal and com pletely turned the tide. In an atmosphere of mutual part nership, empathy, and understanding, he received, for the \nfirst time in four decades, a plausible explanation for his \npersistent diarrhea and the numerous other more recent \nsymptoms. The immense relief and calming, positive effect \nof finally being so well informed after a long and arduous \njourney cannot be overstated. Suddenly, his condition and \nsymptoms made perfect sense. He could scarcely have \nenvisaged that his health issues did not stem from remit ted Crohn’s disease and recurring flu-like episodes due to a \ncompromised immune system, as previously suggested by \nsome specialists. Instead, he discovered that, in addition to \nCrohn’s disease, he had developed diarrhea-predominant \nirritable bowel syndrome, exacerbated by the severe gas trointestinal infection in spring 2019, to which a chronic \nfatigue syndrome then became associated. He learned that \nhis flu-like symptoms could be reinterpreted as conse quences of vegetative nervous system dysfunction, brought \non by chronic life stress. This new understanding provided \ninvaluable insight into the origins and interrelations of his \nsymptoms. Nevertheless, during that 30-minute patientcentered consultation, he could not have anticipated the \nremarkable success of the proposed interventions that \nwould soon follow.\nReplacing loperamide with opium tincture, having an \nearly dinner, and managing his physical activities led to \nan immediate and substantial improvement in his quality \nof life within just a few days. Diarrhea episodes reduced \ndramatically from up to four times a day to only once or \ntwice a day on just two to three days a month. The fre quency and intensity of bloating, abdominal pain, head ache, brain fog, dizziness, impaired memory, extreme \ntiredness, and insomnia also significantly decreased over \nthe following months, although strong bilateral hip joint \npain persisted. For the first time in 5 years, he was able \nto undertake long-distance flights to North America and \nvisit family and friends in the Asia–Pacific region.\nL-glutamine further enhanced and stabilized his con dition. Within 4–6 weeks, general fatigue, brain fog, \ndizziness, impaired memory, and extreme tiredness had \nlargely dissipated. Bloating still occurred occasionally \nafter acute stress or physical exertion but was mild and \nPage 15 of 18\n Haedrich and Huber  Journal of Medical Case Reports            (2025) 19:9 \n \nmostly pain-free. With few exceptions, his sleep duration \nnormalized to 6–7 hours. His diet expanded to include, \nfor the first time in 43  years, wholegrain bread, hard \ncheese, and French fries. He tolerated up to 90 minutes at \nan ice rink without subsequent flu-like or gastrointestinal \nsymptoms, and similarly fared well after an interconti nental flight. However, reducing his daily intake of L-glu tamine from 20 to 10 g on a trial basis resulted in bloating \nand general discomfort, which resolved within a few days \nupon resuming the 20  g dose. Currently, even without \npainkillers, he experiences only minor and diminishing \none-sided hip joint pain. Instead of dressing excessively \nwarm to prevent shivering, as had been necessary even \non warm summer days for the past 5 years, he now enjoys \nwearing T-shirts again in temperatures above 20 °C. He \nfeels more resilient and is able to work intensively for 8 \nhours a day without gastrointestinal complaints. Com ing to terms with his medical history has brought a deep \nsense of relief and optimism for the future. In essence, \nthanks to a skilled complementary medicine intervention \nand comprehensive education, he finally feels liberated \nfrom the passive “victim role” and has regained his life.\nDiscussion and",
    "Conclusion": "conclusion\nOur case presentation illustrates several key aspects. \nFirstly, it shows that functional diseases (IBS) may occur \nsimultaneously with severe organic diseases (IBD) and \nthat differentiation can be challenging and may be over looked. Gastroenterologists may have overly focused on \nendoscopy, while psychosomatic specialists might have \nbeen uncertain about their ability to assist this patient. \nSecondly, it exemplary shows the bidirectional inter relation between IBS, CFS, and fibromyalgia/somato form pain syndrome. The organic disease (IBD) and IBS \npresented first, then CFS occurred during a period of \nmassive psychological stress, with the pain syndrome \nsubsequently settling on top. Resolution of symptoms \noccurred in the same order: IBS improved first, followed \nby CFS, and finally, the pain disappeared. It is known \nthat the combination of IBS, CFS, and fibromyalgia/\nchronic pain syndrome is interlinked and indicative of \na more severe course than any of these conditions alone \n[80]. Not all fibromyalgia criteria were met (only hip pain \nand fatigue), but in the absence of explanatory organic \nfindings, the hip pain can most likely be interpreted as \na somatoform symptom. Thirdly, the case report dem onstrates the importance of understanding and explain ing the patient’s symptoms, even though some, such as \ndeterioration after exposure to cold air, are unusual. An \nin-depth history-taking, the uncovering of traumatic \nlife experiences since early childhood, and knowledge of \nautonomic nervous system regulation, temperature regu lation, and psycho-neuro-immunological connections proved instrumental in explaining these symptoms. The \nGerman S3 Guideline on Irritable Bowel Syndrome [81] \nemphasizes the importance of properly explaining the \nnature of functional connections such as the gut–brain \naxis. However, the expertise of how to explain these con nections is beyond the guideline and, to our knowledge, \nis not an integrative part of the curriculum for medical \nstudents, at least in Germany. Furthermore, this case \nillustrates that a transparent, comprehensible explanation \nof symptoms, combined with effective symptom man agement, can lead to rapid and sustained improvement \neven in a severe, longstanding case of IBS lasting decades \nand CFS persisting for 3 years. While self-management \nstrategies (such as paced physical training, relaxation \ntechniques, structured daily routines, and dietary adjust ments) were beneficial and are recommended in treat ment guidelines for IBS [81] and CFS [82–84], they \nalone would not explain the rapid improvement start ing already a few days after the initial visit. We assume \nthat physical training and relaxation techniques needed \nmore time to improve our patient’s physical fitness, selftrust, and autonomic regulation. Further important fac tors contributing to the favorable outcome included, in \nour view, the patient’s excellent motivation, intellectual \ncapacity to understand the explanations, proactive cop ing strategies, and trust in both the attending specialist \nand the treatment process.\nAbbreviations\nAUC   Area under the curve\nBM  Bowel movement\nBRS  Baroreceptor sensitivity\nC6G  Codeine-6-glucuronide\nCD  Crohn’s disease\nCDAI  Crohn’s Disease Activity Index\nCFS  Chronic fatigue syndrome\nCFU  Colony-forming unit\nCNS  Central nervous system\nCRP  C-reactive protein\nDGBI  Disorder of gut–brain interaction\nENS  Enteric nervous system\nESR  Erythrocyte sedimentation rate\nFM  Fibromyalgia\nGMC  General medical condition\nHPA  Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal\nHR  Heart rate\nIBD  Inflammatory bowel disease\nIBS  Irritable bowel syndrome\nIBS-D  Irritable bowel syndrome with predominant diarrhea\nICR  Ileocecal resection\nM3G  Morphine-3-glucuronide\nM6G  Morphine-6-glucuronide\nMGB  Microbiota–gut–brain\nMRI  Magnetic resonance imaging\nOGD  Esophagogastroduodenoscopy\nPI-IBS  Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome\nPNS  Parasympathetic nervous system\nU/S  Ultrasound imaging (sonography)\nUC  Ulcerative colitis\nUZN  Uni-Zentrum Naturheilkunde (University Center for Complementary \nMedicine)\nPage 16 of 18 Haedrich and Huber  Journal of Medical Case Reports            (2025) 19:9 \nAcknowledgements\nNone.\nAuthor contributions\nRH evaluated the patient’s medical history, provided diagnostical interpre tation, therapeutic approach, and conceptual design of this case report. \nRH contributed the “Discussion and conclusion” section, prepared the final \nmanuscript and supervised the project.
