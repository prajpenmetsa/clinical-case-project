    "Background": "Background The co-occurrence of deep vein thrombosis with vascular aneurysms, whether venous or arterial, seems \nto be uncommon. This case report details a patient who experienced an isolated rupture of the right common iliac \naneurysm 1 year after a deep vein thrombosis episode.",
    "Case Presentation": "Case presentation A 20-year-old Iranian female with a history of deep vein thrombosis DVT was treated with rivar oxaban but later presented with a ruptured right common iliac aneurysm. Surgical intervention was successful, \nbut she developed persistent abdominal pain, small bowel obstruction, and a large pancreatic pseudocyst requiring \ndrainage. Despite continued anticoagulant therapy, a thrombosed graft was observed, although the patient remains \nasymptomatic for organ ischemia or blood supply disorders.",
    "Conclusion": "Conclusion The association of deep vein thrombosis with vascular aneurysms is a rare occurrence. It is important \nto consider aneurysm-related flow disturbances and compression effects on veins when evaluating patients with concurrent deep vein thrombosis and aneurysms. Behçet’s disease, Hughes–Stovin syndrome, chronic traumatic arterio venous fistula, and recurrent nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteremia can also contribute to this association.\nKeywords  Deep venous thrombosis, Venous thromboembolism, Aneurysm, Coexisting DVT and arterial aneurysm, \nIsolated aneurysm, Case report",
    "Introduction": "Introduction\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) and aortic aneurysms rep resent critical vascular conditions with distinct patho physiological mechanisms. DVT involves the formation \nof blood clots within deep calf veins, while aortic aneu rysms result from weakened segments in the aorta [1–6].However, intriguingly, there exists a rare interplay \nbetween these two entities. Case reports suggest that \narterial aneurysms can occasionally precipitate DVT by \ncompressing nearby veins, disrupting blood flow, and \npotentially leading to clot formation [7–22]. In this case \nreport, we delve into this unique relationship, exploring a \ncase involving coexisting DVT, aortic aneurysm, and iliac \nartery aneurysm under low-risk circumstances.\nCase presentation\nA 20-year-old Iranian female patient with a prior his tory of left lower limb deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at \nage 19 years underwent a coagulation factor evaluation. \nTest",

Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:596 \nunderlying cause for the DVT was identified. The patient \nreceived anticoagulation therapy consisting of rivaroxa ban, 10 mg, twice daily, for 6 months.\nOne year later, at the age of 20 years, the patient pre sented with abdominal and flank pain accompanied by \npallor. Upon initial presentation with abdominal and \nflank pain, the patient displayed notable pallor, sug gestive of anemia secondary to acute blood loss. Vital \nsigns revealed hypotension with a blood pressure of \n85/50  mmHg and tachycardia, with a heart rate of 120 \nbeats per minute. Clinical examination revealed tender ness in the right lower abdominal quadrant with guard ing, but no rebound tenderness was observed. Initial \nlaboratory tests indicated a significant drop in hemo globin to 6 g/dL, further supporting hemorrhagic anemia \nlikely owing to the intraabdominal and pelvic hemor rhage. Other laboratory values showed mildly elevated \nwhite blood cell counts. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels \nwere within the normal range. Renal and liver function \ntests were within normal limits, and electrolytes were \nbalanced.\nFollowing initial evaluations and a high clinical suspi cion of intraabdominal and pelvic hemorrhage, a com puted tomography (CT) angiography was performed \nafter stabilizing the patient. The imaging revealed signifi cant dilation of the right common iliac artery, accompa nied by rupture and mural thrombi along the arterial wall \n(Fig.  1). This finding confirmed the presence of an iso lated right common iliac aneurysm with rupture, necessi tating immediate surgical intervention to prevent further \ncomplications.\nIntraoperatively, given the complete rupture of the \nright common iliac, closure of the right internal iliac \nartery was achieved with an 8-mm Dacron graft extend ing from the origin of the right common iliac to the right \nexternal iliac. Following the procedure, the patient’s pulse was restored, and she was transferred to the intensive \ncare unit (ICU), where she was stabilized.\nPostoperatively, the patient regained consciousness \nwith a restored pulse; however, severe abdominal pain \npersisted, necessitating analgesic management. A followup CT scan revealed no new abnormalities. Suspecting \ninflammation, hydrocortisone was administered, which \nrelieved the pain. She was discharged on corticosteroids, \nand subsequent rheumatological testing returned normal \nresults.\nApproximately 6 weeks later, the patient presented \nwith symptoms indicative of small bowel obstruction. \nInitial conservative management was attempted, but as \nabdominal distension worsened and a large pancreatic \npseudocyst was visualized on a CT scan, a laparotomy \nwas performed to relieve obstructive symptoms caused \nby the cyst’s compression on the intestinal tract (Fig.  2). \nThe pseudocyst was successfully drained. Postoperatively, \nthe patient continued to produce 600–700  cc of secre tions daily even after a month, prompting the addition \nof oral pancreatin therapy. Rheumatological tests and \nrepeat coagulation factor assessments remained negative. \nEvaluation for the potential necessity of a distal pancrea tectomy to address the pseudocyst is ongoing.\nPathological examination of the aneurysm sac identi fied only an inflammatory aneurysm with no additional \nfindings. During the treatment course, the patient also \nexperienced a right ureteral stone, managed conserva tively. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels remained within \nthe normal range. The patient is currently maintained \non anticoagulant therapy. A follow-up CT scan showed \nFig. 1 Isolated rupture of right iliac artery aneurysm (red arrow)\nFig. 2 Pancreatic pseudocyst (red arrow) and the right iliac artery, \nbypassed using graft (yellow arrow), are shown\nPage 3 of 5\n Ghasemi Gorji et al.

Despite this finding, the patient \nremains asymptomatic, with no evidence of organ \nischemia or compromised blood flow.",
    "Discussion": "Discussion\nDeep vein thrombosis (DVT) affects the venous system \nin the lower limbs. It initiates clot formation in a deep \ncalf vein, leading to an obstructive condition that ham pers the venous reflux mechanism [1].\nIliac artery aneurysms are rare, more commonly \nobserved in older men, and have a relatively slow pro gression but a higher risk of rupture as they increase in \nsize. Early detection and proper management are crucial \nowing to the significantly higher mortality rate associated \nwith emergency surgical interventions [23]. Embolization \nof the internal iliac artery (IIA) is a common occurrence \nduring endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) \nrepair, and unilateral IIA embolization is well tolerated, \nenabling effective endovascular treatment options for \npatients with AAA and iliac artery aneurysms [24].\nFurthermore, some researchers have reported cases of \niliac artery aneurysms presenting with lower extremity \ndeep vein thrombosis [20] or cases in which an external \niliac artery aneurysm causes severe venous obstruction \n[15]. It seems that the association of DVT with any vas cular aneurysm (whether venous or arterial aneurysm) \nis more common in men than in women. Among the \n16 patients who had an aneurysm and DVT at the same \ntime, 14 of them were men. Most patients were in the \nsixth to seventh decade of life, although there were cases \nfrom the third, fourth, and fifth decade [25–36]. Car diovascular diseases, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and \nsmoking were the most common underlying risk factors \namong people who had DVT and aneurysms, although \nmost people had no underlying disease [25–27, 29–31, \n33, 36].\nIn certain instances, arterial aneurysms have resulted \nin flow disturbances and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) \nby exerting pressure on the veins [25, 27–30, 36]. Most \npatients presenting with both DVT and arterial aneu rysms concurrently typically had an aneurysm in the \nabdominal aorta (AAA), particularly in the infrarenal \naorta [27– 29, 36]. It is widely acknowledged that AAA \ncan obstruct the small bowel and the ureter. Cases of \nDVT due to compression by an AAA are uncommon \n[37]. This condition is frequently associated with fibro sis caused by inflammatory AAA. AAA without fibrosis \nhas been reported to cause IVC compression and DVT \nwhen exceeding 6  cm in width. Inflammatory AAAs \nare more likely to manifest symptoms (80%), while it \nis uncommon for noninflammatory aneurysms to be \nsymptomatic (7–30%) [17]. This case illustrates that the IVC compression by the AAA is severe enough to cause \nflow abnormalities with unilateral DVT [29].\nIn one of the cases, DVT was linked to venous aneu rysm [26]. Venous aneurysms, especially those affecting \nthe inferior vena cava (IVC), are rare. A 2008 literature \nreview showed that IVC involvement was observed \nin only 3 of 29 reported venous aneurysms [38]. The \npatient with a venous aneurysm and DVT was younger \nthan those with arterial aneurysms, [26] at 33 years old. \nThe most common types of IVC aneurysms associated \nwith DVT are type II–IV. Therefore, an IVC aneurysm \nshould be considered in the differential diagnosis of the \netiology of DVT [26].\nBehçet’s disease was observed in 3 out of 15 cases. \nBehçet’s disease (BD) is a complex vasculitis with \nvarious vascular manifestations, including venous \nthrombosis, arterial thrombosis/aneurysm/pseudoa neurysm, and co-associated venous thrombosis and \narterial lesions. The same inflammatory process appears \nresponsible for arterial and venous involvement in \npatients with BD [39]. One of these three cases had \nHughes–Stovin syndrome. Hughes–Stovin syndrome is \nan incomplete form of Behçet’s syndrome characterized \nby recurrent thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombo sis, and multiple pulmonary and bronchial aneurysms. \nPatients with Hughes–Stovin syndrome typically do not \npresent with oral or genital ulcerations, skin lesions, \niritis, or arthralgia, unlike those with Behçet’s disease \n[33].\nAnother case report of DVT and aneurysm involves \nchronic traumatic arteriovenous fistula (AVF). Chronic \ntraumatic AVF is linked to unrecognized or untreated \npenetrating vascular injury. Closure of all AVFs appeared \nto be the optimal treatment option [31].\nThe remaining case reports are associated with recur rent nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteremia. Mycotic \naneurysms are a well-recognized complication of non typhoidal Salmonella bacteremia; the risk is elevated \nin patients with atherosclerotic disease. The infrarenal \nabdominal aorta is the most common site of infection, \nand its compressive mechanisms can cause DVT [40].\nA femoral artery aneurysm (FAA) is an uncommon \nperipheral vascular aneurysm that can lead to throm bosis, embolism, and life-threatening rupture if left \nuntreated. The manifestations of FAA range from the dis covery of an asymptomatic mass during regular physical \nexamination to the emergence of acute limb-threatening \nischemia. Recently, a case involving FAA resulting in \ndeep vein thrombosis and compartment syndrome has \nbeen documented. While the conventional treatment for \nFAA typically involves an open surgical approach, in this \ninstance, an endovascular intervention was undertaken \nowing to the significant surgical mortality risk [41].\nPage 4 of 5 Ghasemi Gorji et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:596 \nIn another case report, the authors describe a patient \nfound to have an undiagnosed abdominal aortic aneu rysm. The patient presented to the emergency depart ment with sudden swelling in one leg following the \nrupture of the aneurysm into the vena cava. Upon con ducting an abdominal examination, concerns arose about \npotential intraabdominal pathology, which was subse quently confirmed through a bedside ultrasound exami nation, leading to a computed tomography evaluation of \nthe aorta. The patient was expeditiously transferred for \nurgent surgical intervention and experienced a favora ble recovery outcome. This case serves as a sobering \nreminder to healthcare providers that, while unilateral \nleg swelling is a prevalent symptom encountered in front line settings, deep vein thrombosis is not the sole impor tant differential diagnosis to consider [42].\nConclusion\nThe association of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with \nvascular aneurysms, whether venous or arterial, appears \nto be a rare occurrence. The majority of reported cases \ninvolve men, particularly in the sixth to seventh decade \nof life. Underlying risk factors such as cardiovascular \ndiseases, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking are \ncommonly observed in these individuals. It is crucial to \nconsider the possibility of aneurysm-related flow distur bances and compression effects on veins when evaluating \npatients with concurrent DVT and aneurysms. Addition ally, the presence of Behçet’s disease, Hughes–Stovin \nsyndrome, chronic traumatic arteriovenous fistula, and \nrecurrent nontyphoidal Salmonella bacteremia as poten tial contributors to this association should not be over looked. Further research and awareness are needed to \nbetter understand and manage this rare but clinically sig nificant phenomenon.\nAbbreviations\nDVT  Deep vein thrombosis\nAAA   Abdominal aortic aneurysm\nCRP  C-reactive protein\nIVC  Inferior vena cava\nAVF  Arteriovenous fistula\nBD  Behçet’s disease\nFAA  Femoral artery aneurysm\nIIA  Internal iliac artery\nICU  Intensive care unit\nCT  Computed tomography\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable\nAuthor contributions\nAmirhossein Rajabi, Sina Sohrabizadeh, Mahtab Asgari, and Ali Rafiei were \nresponsible for the initial writing of the case presentation and collecting the \nappropriate figures, and participating in exploring the latest relevant findings \nin the literature.
