    "Background": "Background Achalasia is characterized as an esophageal motility disorder with incomplete relaxation of the lower \nesophageal sphincter. Achalasia can be associated with abnormal peristalsis and symptoms of dysphagia, acid reflux, \nand chest pain. The exact pathophysiology of achalasia remains unclear, but it is hypothesized to be due to degeneration of the myenteric plexus.",
    "Case Presentation": "Case presentation In this case, a 46-year-old Hispanic man presented to the emergency room with a 12-year history of progressive discomfort with swallowing solids and liquids. Due to many years of incomplete follow-up care \nand lack of understanding of the course of his disease, this patient’s symptoms escalated to complete intolerance \nof oral intake and significant weight loss. He was diagnosed with achalasia during his hospital stay and treated successfully with laparoscopic Heller myotomy.\nConclusions This case",
    "Discussion": "discussion illustrates the importance of follow-up care and patient education so that diagno sis and treatment of achalasia are not delayed.\nKeywords  Achalasia, Dysphagia, Esophagram, Heller myotomy, Case report\nBackground\nAchalasia is a rare condition that causes esophageal \nmotor dysfunction due to lack of relaxation in the lower \nesophageal sphincter (LES). The incidence of achalasia \nvaries throughout the world, but the approximate world wide annual incidence is 1/100,000 [1, 2]. The condition \ntypically presents with symptoms of dysphagia with sol ids that progresses to an intolerance of liquids. Nonspe cific symptoms of regurgitation along with chest pain, \ncough, and weight loss are common [1, 3]. Due to dys phagia and other symptoms, patients often adopt certain \nhabits such as eating more slowly and avoiding meals in \npublic settings. These techniques can slow the progres sion of the discomfort a patient may experience and can \ndelay a need to seek medical attention [4].The pathophysiology of achalasia is not well defined \nbut is thought to be related to the degeneration of the \nmyenteric plexus, a network of nerve cells between the \nlayers of esophageal muscles, which are responsible for \nperistalsis and relaxation of the lower esophageal sphinc ter. There have been associations between achalasia and \nparasitic infections (Trypanosoma cruzi), viral infections \n(Herpes simplex virus), malignancies (esophageal), as well \nas autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythe matosus [5]. Approximately 7–10% of individuals with \nachalasia are infected with T. cruzi, also known as Chagas \ndisease [6].\nThere are various treatment approaches for acha lasia including endoscopic treatment via balloon dila tation, botulinum toxin, laparoscopic Heller myotomy, \nand esophagectomy [7]. A meta-analysis performed by \nSchoenberg et  al. concluded that laparoscopic Heller \nmyotomy should be considered first-line treatment of \nachalasia as it demonstrates greater efficacy than balloon *Correspondence:\nSabrina Ginsburg\nssg90@miami.edu\n1 University of Miami Leonard M.

He described a “tight” sensa tion in his chest any time he ingested food or drink and \nstated that the contents were getting stuck in his throat. \nHe could no longer eat foods larger than half an inch \nand would have postprandial vomiting with any larger \nsubstance. The patient felt that his voice was becom ing progressively hoarse and he was experiencing occa sional symptoms of reflux. He reported that he had lost \napproximately 10 lbs over the past 2 months because of \nthese symptoms, and a total of 55 lbs since the onset of \nhis symptoms 12  years prior (starting weight: 220 lbs, \nweight on admission: 165 lbs). He denied odynophagia or \nrecent fevers, chills, headaches, lightheadedness, cough, \nshortness of breath, chest pain, back pain, abdominal \npain, diarrhea, constipation, or dysuria. His past medical \nhistory was significant for hypertension, for which he was \ntaking amlodipine, and he was taking no other medica tions. He had a previous history of appendectomy but \notherwise denied any abdominal surgeries. He was born \nin Mexico, worked as a landscaper, and was an active \nsmoker with a 30-pack year history. He denied any alco hol or illicit drug use, and denied any family history of \ngastrointestinal disorders or malignancies.\nThe patient had visited the emergency room at other \nhospitals multiple times over the past few years for simi lar symptoms without a definitive diagnosis or treat ment. On presentation to our hospital, his initial vital \nsigns were unremarkable. His laboratory",
    "Results": "results showed a \nwhite blood cell count of 15.2/µL, hemoglobin of 12.5 g/\ndL, and a platelet count of 178,000/µL. Electrolytes, cre atinine, and liver enzymes were all within normal limits. \nThe patient was administered 1 L of normal saline and \nmetoclopramide for nausea.\nA chest x-ray revealed questionable gaseous disten tion of the esophagus and a computed tomography (CT) \nof the chest/neck was performed for further evaluation. \nThe CT revealed a significantly distended esophagus with \ndistal tapering at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction and \nstenosis of the lower esophageal sphincter, suggestive of \nachalasia without a mass lesion. The CT visualized asso ciated fluid and food contents putting this patient at risk \nfor aspiration. These findings were concerning for struc tural or functional dysmotility.\nDuring hospitalization, an esophagram confirmed \nachalasia with a classic “bird-beak” configuration. Fig ure 1 represents an example of a dilated upper esophagus with the tapered narrowing of the distal esophagus com monly referred to as the bird-beak deformity [9]. Pathol ogy from esophageal biopsies revealed Candida (likely \ndue to stasis from dysmotility) and treatment with intra venous fluconazole was initiated. Peripheral blood smear \nruled out Chagas disease. On day 8 of his hospitalization, \nhe was taken to the operating room (OR) for laparoscopic \nHeller myotomy with no complications. On day 11, a fol low-up esophagram was completed and revealed normal \nfindings with mild ballooning of the distal esophagus. The \npatient was discharged on day 12 after the patient was \ntolerating a bariatric stage 1 diet. He remained hemody namically stable throughout his hospital stay. The patient \nvisited the clinic 4  days after discharge and was able to \ntolerate a clear liquid diet. He denied nausea, vomiting, \nhematemesis, reflux, or bloody stools. A total of 1 week \nafter discharge, he was able to tolerate a regular diet.\nDiscussion\nThe emergency department (ED) focuses on stabiliz ing and immediately ruling out life threatening ill nesses. Many of the patients who are stable and have \nno urgent need for hospital admission are discharged \nand encouraged to follow up with a primary care pro vider. The rising wait time, lack of accessible clinics, \nFig. 1 Bird-beak deformity of distal esophagus in a patient \nwith achalasia. Reproduced with permission from: Xiang et al.  [9]\nPage 3 of 4\n Ginsburg et al. Journal of Medical Case Reports          (2024) 18:502 \n \nand insurance barriers make the transition from the \nED to a primary care physician (PCP) outpatient \nappointment anything but seamless. In a recent study \nled by Yale University, it was shown that only 26% of \npeople from this sample who were discharged from the \nED were able to get a PCP appointment within a week \n[10].\nIn this case report, the patient went to the ED mul tiple times with a slight progression in the disease \ncourse with each visit, over a period of 12 years. It was \nnot until the final visit, where he was completely solid \nfood intolerant, that a diagnosis of achalasia was deter mined. Because of its rarity, achalasia is known to have \na greater delay from symptom onset to final diagnosis \nwith the average being 4–5 years [1 ]. Unfortunately for \nthis patient, he was symptomatic for 12  years before \nreceiving his diagnosis and treatment, which is more \nthan double the average time lapse.\nChagas disease, commonly seen in South America, \nhas a known association with achalasia. The esopha gopathy seen with Chagas disease is known to have a \nslow development over many years [7 ]. No evidence for \nChagas disease was found in this patient. Another con tributing factor to this patient’s late diagnosis was his \nlow health literacy and the lack of continuity of care. \nHealth literacy is recognized as a stronger predictor of \nunfavorable health outcomes compared to age, income, \nemployment status, education level, or race [11]. \nPatients with low health literacy utilize more resources \nthrough continued trips to the emergency room and \nexperience more frequent hospitalizations. A system atic review analyzing patients in emergency depart ments found that a large group of the patients did not \nhave adequate health literacy, which contributes to \nmore frequent ED use and overall, more resources \nbeing used [12].\nAchalasia is a rare disease with a broad presentation \nthat can be associated with diagnostic delay and mis diagnoses. There are few published articles about the \nrecognized delay in diagnosis for achalasia compared \nwith other conditions. Although not understood, atypi cal symptoms on presentation, misleading descriptions, \nand misinterpretations of diagnostic studies seem \nto be the leading variables. A study by Muller et  al. \ncompared these variables with 300 patients recently \ndiagnosed with achalasia. The results showed that the \npresentation of “heartburn” or “nausea” was associ ated with a higher rate of delay in diagnosis [13]. Medi cal professionals should consider achalasia in patients \nwith such symptoms. Inflammation of the esophageal \nmucosa after years of food impaction can cause reten tion esophagitis, which results in an increased risk for \nesophageal cancer [14].",
    "Conclusion": "Conclusion\nThe diagnosis of achalasia, a rare disorder causing \nesophageal dysmotility, can be delayed several years \nfor a number of reasons including insidious onset, non specific symptoms, and low health literacy. To improve \nquality of life in patients with achalasia and prevent \nlong term complications, it must remain on the differ ential for dysphagia so that the length of time between \nsymptom onset to treatment is decreased. This will \nrequire vigilant screening in PCP and ED settings.\nAbbreviations\nLES  Lower esophageal sphincter\nED  Emergency department\nPCP  Primary care physician\nAcknowledgements\nNot applicable.\nAuthor contributions\nSG, CC, and GA contributed to writing the case report.
